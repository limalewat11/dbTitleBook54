Three little fish swim out into the deep blue sea to build their homes. Jim builds a "weedy little house," Tim builds a "sandy little house," and Kim takes up residence in a sunken ship. It isn't long before the big bad shark shows up at each successive residence, calling "Little fish, little fish, let me come in!" Children will quickly join in the answering refrain, "Not by the skin of my finny fin fin!" Gorton's whimsical, computer-drawn scenery and electric color palette set just the right tone for Geist's tongue-in-cheek retelling. The bold font is humorously integrated with the art, appearing inside the shark's mouth for emphasis, or swirling along the current with an escaping fish. This spunky tale is a welcome addition to storytime and picture-book collections.&#x2014;<i>Jayne Damron, Farmington Community Library, MI</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But what happens when a bag breaks or is no longer needed? In Njau, Gambia, people simply dropped the bags and went on their way. One plastic bag became two. Then ten. Then a hundred. <br> The bags accumulated in ugly heaps alongside roads. Water pooled in them, bringing mosquitoes and disease. Some bags were burned, leaving behind a terrible smell. Some were buried, but they strangled gardens. They killed livestock that tried to eat them. Something had to change. <br> Isatou Ceesay was that change. She found a way to recycle the bags and transform her community. This inspirational true story shows how one person's actions really can make a difference in our world.</p></p><p><p><strong>Miranda Paul </strong>is the award-winning author of more than a dozen books for children, including <em>One Plastic Bag</em> and Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book Honoree <em>Nine Months Before a Baby Is Born</em>.

She currently lives in Albany, New York.

Then the problem spread to the villages. In Njau, Gambia, a young woman named Isatou Ceesay became concerned; when she learned that these non-biodegradable objects, discarded after breakage and tears made them no longer usable, were attracting disease-bearing insects and that domestic animals often died after eating the bags, she decided to do something about it. Author Paul has written a clear and sensitive account of Ceesay and her fellow activists' ingenious solution to the plastic bag problem (they wash them, cut the bags into strips, and crochet the strips into small purses to sell in the city). Zunon's collages, with their vivid colors, elegant patterns, and varied textures&#x2015;especially those from actual plastic bags&#x2015;provide a beautiful and authentic entry into the story. An informative author's note, glossary, timeline, and suggestions for further reading accompany the story. <strong>This handsome presentation of grassroots environmental activism is certain to inspire young readers.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>The Horn Book Magazine</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"The simple format of this picture book belies the strength of its content, a story lovingly supported by charming collage illustrations. As a girl, Ceesay realized that the goats on which her village relied were dying because they were eating plastic bags. She also saw that people were tossing the used bags on the ground just as they had always thrown away their baskets when no longer useful&#x2015;except the plastic bags, unlike the baskets, weren't biodegradable. So Ceesay figured out how to use crochet, a skill with which the villagers were already familiar, to make purses out of the plastic bags. <strong>Simple but lyrical text conveys this beautiful, thought-provoking tale of ecological awareness and recycling </strong>('The basket tips. One fruit tumbles. Then two. Then ten.'). <strong>An inspiring account.</strong>" &#x2015;starred, <em>School Library Journal</em> </p><p> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"As Isatou Ceesay, a young woman in Njau, Gambia, drops and breaks the basket of fruit she is carrying, she discovers an abandoned bag made of a strange fabric&#x2015;plastic. At first these brightly colored bags seem convenient throughout the village, but as they break, they are discarded. As 1 becomes 2, then 10, then 100, their beauty turns into a growing pile of filth that attracts dirty water, mosquitos, and a stench. When the problem worsens as goats begin to eat the bags and die, Isatou and her friends devise a clever plan that's initially met with ridicule. They wash the bags, cut and roll them into plastic thread, and crochet them into purses, all in secret. But when 1, then 2, then 10 women buy them, proud entrepreneur Isatou soon has enough money to buy a new goat and relishes the returned beauty of her village. <strong>Colorful textured and patterned collage artwork illustrates this inspiring true story, which concludes with more information about Isatou's grassroots initiative.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Distressed by the problem of plastic-bag disposal, a Gambian woman organizes her neighbors to turn trash into treasure.When Isatou Ceesay first discovered plastic bags in the Gambia in West Africa, in the 1980s, they seemed wonderfully useful and sturdy. But in her village, they soon became a nuisance, piling up in ugly dump areas where mosquitoes bred. Goats ate them and died. Her solution was to collect and clean used bags, cut them into strips and crochet the strips into useful plastic purses. These were sold at local markets and eventually internationally. Paul, who first went to the Gambia as a volunteer and has returned in other roles, tells this story in a straightforward fashion, deftly including words from the Wolof language and including details about Ceesay's village life. A map, author's note, glossary, timeline and excellent suggestions for further reading set this example of a woman who made a difference in a larger context. Fittingly, the collage illustrations make use of colorful papers and plastic bags. These reveal the labor involved and show the women's joy in the results of their work. <strong>Though Isatou Ceesay's country may be unfamiliar to young readers, they've probably done some handicraft recycling of their own. The easy connection makes this a welcome addition to the small shelf of examples of ingenuity in developing nations.</strong>" &#x2015;<em>Kirkus Reviews</em> </p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"One woman's efforts to rid her Gambian village of trash sparks a recycling movement in this uplifting tale inspired by true events. As a girl, Inatou admired the colors and myriad uses of the plastic bags that began to proliferate in her community. But years later, the same plastic bags, festering in trash heaps or floating through the air, have become a menace to humans and animals. Compelled to make her home beautiful, Inatou gathers the bags, cleans them, and crochets them into purses. She teaches other women to do the same, and an ecologically-minded enterprise is born. <strong>Notes of hope, determination, and empowerment suffuse Paul's story</strong>, which the author explains was informed by her volunteer work as a teacher in the Gambia. <strong>Incorporating real plastic bags into her mixed-media collages, Zunon, who grew up in West Africa, juxtaposes the brown, dusty landscape against splashes of color and vibrant printed dresses and head coverings worn by the village women.</strong> A glossary and list of suggested reading are included." &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>Low Sodium Slow Cooker Cookbook: Over 100 Heart Healthy Recipes that Prep Fast and Cook Slow</h2><p><p><strong><em>The Low-Sodium Slow Cooker Cookbook</em> puts flavor back into your slow cooker with tasty, heart-healthy recipes.</strong></p><p>From Cheese Grits to Turkey Chili to Mongolian Beef&#x2015;you can use the convenience of your slow cooker to spice up your low-sodium diet. <em>The Low-Sodium Slow Cooker Cookbook</em> makes it easy to enjoy time-saving meals that are high on flavor but low in sodium.

In retrospect, this was just one of the most popular expressions of Giger&#x2019;s biomechanical arsenal of creatures, which consistently merged hybrids of human and machine into images of haunting power and dark psychedelia.</p><p>The visions drew on demons of the past, harking back as far as Giger&#x2019;s earliest childhood fears as well as evoking mythologies for the future. Above all, they gave expression to the collective fears and fantasies of his age: fear of the atom, of pollution and wasted resources, and of a future in which our bodies depend on machines for survival.</p><p>From surrealist dream landscapes created with a spray gun and stencils to album cover designs, from guillotine-like sculptures to self-designed bars, Giger personally guides us through his multi-faceted universe in this definitive introduction to a master of horror. Detailed reproductions and designs and a foreword by Timothy Leary complement Giger&#x2019;s intimate autobiographical texts.</p></p><p>H.R. Giger (1940 2014) was a Swiss surrealist painter, sculptor, and set designer. He first received acclaim in the 1960s with his airbrushed fantasy landscapes, and rose to fame through high profile movie work, most notably as part of the team behind the visual effects in Alien, which won an Academy Award. H.R Giger was named in the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2013.</p><h2>Stitchcraft: An Embroidery Book of Simple Stitches and Peculiar Patterns</h2><p><b>Step inside a world of arcane imagery and rich esoteric symbolism in this deeply imaginative embroidery art book!</b><br><br>Author Gayla Partridge draws upon her knowledge of phrenology, anatomy, floral design, and Ouija to create unique twists on an age-old craft.&nbsp;Through extraordinary, stylized photography, and detailed close-ups of designs, the pieces in&nbsp;<i>Stitchcraft&nbsp;</i>are entirely achievable with basic embroidery stitches and easy-to-follow instructions, enchanting embroidery beginners and experts alike.&nbsp;<br><i>Stitchcraft&nbsp;</i>features:&nbsp;<br><br><i>�&nbsp;</i>30 intricate pieces, designed using a combination of nine basic stitches<br><i>�&nbsp;</i>Insight from the author on the creation of each original piece<br><i>�&nbsp;</i>30 basic patterns to get the reader started creating their own version of the pieces<br>From the anatomy of snakes to bountiful bouquets, from Dia de Los Muertos to a threaded Virgin Mary, readers will be inspired to recreate Partridge&#x2019;s exclusive designs, and to make them their own.</p><p><p>A note from the author on her approach in <em>Stitchcraft</em>: Although I do provide basic patterns at the back of this book, I don&#x2019;t feel it is necessary to follow an embroidery pattern.

Wedged into the backseat on our road trip to Houston right before Christmas, I gave my sound-bite answers, not wanting to take up too much of the oxygen in the car and knowing that my life, in comparison to so many, is just not as hard as it sometimes feels.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t buy it. Bekah pressed in again. &#x201c;I see it, Jennie. I see it on you and in you. You feel so much pressure. Where is the pressure coming from?&#x201d;<br><br>I looked out the car window. Tears burned in my eyes, but I wouldn&#x2019;t let them fall. I couldn&#x2019;t decide if I actually wanted to go there and feel it all. As much as I tried to mean it when I declared, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m good,&#x201d; a steady, silent grief had been growing in recent months. It seemed my chest was always tight, and many nights I lay awake half afraid and half trying to trust God with things like . . .<br><br>. . . the nagging insecurities I carry, wondering if any of the ways I am spending my life even matter.<br>. . . the growing challenges we were facing with one of our kids and his special needs<br>. . . . the grief I feel for my baby sister, who is suffering through unthinkable tragedy<br>. . . . the inescapable pressures I feel as I lead a growing organization that has taken on a life of its own<br>. . . . <br>the weariness that all of these pressures and more bring<br>. . . . the sin that is coming out of me toward people I love because of the stress of all of it.<br><br><i>Ugh. Do I go there? What good will it accomplish?</i><br><br>Wanting to keep my composure, I held back as we drove the few hours to Houston. I wanted to hide behind the familiar posturing that would shift everyone&#x2019;s attention onto the next topic.<br><br>I was silent, deciding.<br><br>But they weren&#x2019;t going to stop.<br><br>Subject change. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s stop and eat. Aren&#x2019;t you all hungry?&#x201d;<br><br>They agreed to let me eat if I would open up and tell them how I was really doing. Held hostage by these crazy-good friends, I would have to risk being vulnerable.<br><br>Somehow in the posh suburbs of Houston, we found this little shack of a burger joint with a dirt floor and no central heat. We were the only ones there. We huddled around the outdoor heater and ate some of the best burgers we&#x2019;d ever tasted.<br><br>To the constant concern of our darling waiter, who continually brought me napkins, I fell apart and with a lot of tears gave my friends access to all of me: the constant inadequacy I feel, the fears of letting down those I lead or, even worse, my kids, the constant pressure I try to ignore but never seem to escape, the grief for my sister, the doubt that I&nbsp;often feel toward God even though I preach and write books about Him, the way I had snapped earlier on a poor intern at the office, the constant feeling that no matter how hard I try, I cannot be enough. All the things I didn&#x2019;t want to say, didn&#x2019;t even want to admit to myself, I said them.<br><br>For two solid hours my friends gifted me all the oxygen. They sacrificially and without judgment handed it over and forced me to breathe it in, to lovingly receive it without fear. For the first time in a long time, I laughed hard and free. The deep, happy, make-fun-of-your-life-andyourself kind of laughter.<br><br>For those two hours I let myself be a complete fool who didn&#x2019;t have an iota of her junk together. I was free of the expectations, the roles I play, the pressures of real life. Nothing about my circumstances changed in that moment. But everything on the inside shifted. I didn&#x2019;t realize until then that, accidentally, I&#x2019;d let my life subtly turn into a performance. On that dirt floor, I forgot all of my lines, abandoned all of my roles, dropped all of the costumes . . .<br><br>I had nothing to prove.<br><br>I drank in grace. I hadn&#x2019;t known that was what I&#x2019;d been so thirsty for. Grace. I didn&#x2019;t know until I confessed my thirst on a dirt floor over burgers. My friends had that grace stored up from the contagious grace of Jesus that they all know well. Like a cold stream, Jesus&#x2019;s grace poured out of them into my dry, weary, thirsty soul.<br><br>Maybe you&#x2019;ve known that thirst, that deep-within-your-bones craving for relief? Maybe you feel it right now? I&#x2019;m convinced every one of us is fighting some pressure, some suffering, some sin, some burden&#x2014; perhaps all of those at the same time. Yet what do we all say when we&#x2019;re asked the question, &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d;<br><br>We say, &#x201c;Okay. Fine. Great.&#x201d;<br><br>I have a secret for you: Nobody is okay, fine, great.<br><br>But, goodness, we are all tired of trying to pretend we are.<br><br>Are you tired? You are not alone.<br><br>The truth I found that day on the dirt floor outside Houston is available and true every day for every one of us. <b>We need a new way to live.</b><br><br>Do you want off the stage? Guess what? A cheeseburger and a dirtfloor shack full of grace are waiting for you.<br><br>But I should warn you, there is a full-on war to keep you from finding it. If heaven and God and angels and demons are all real, then a real enemy is out to claim all that is good and free and peaceful and joyful in us.<br><br>So we start here. We start by realizing we are not alone. We start by recognizing that, indeed, all hell will be out to get us if we decide to live free and enjoy grace.<br><br>Ben Rector, one of my favorite musicians, often puts words to music in a way that expresses truth. He wrote, &#x201c;Sometimes the devil sounds a lot like Jesus.&#x201d;1<br><br>We&#x2019;ve been deceived by the lies of an enemy who knows exactly how to twist our thirst to his purposes. And we desperately need to open our eyes to his perverse tactics.<br><br><b>If I Were Your Enemy&nbsp;. . .</b><br><br>If I were your enemy, this is what I would do: <br>Make you believe you need permission to lead. <br>Make you believe you are helpless. <br>Make you believe you are insignificant. <br>Make you believe that God wants your decorum and behavior.<br><br>And for years these lies have been sufficient to shut down much of the church.<br><br>But now many of you are awake. You are in the Word and on your knees. God is moving through you, and you are getting dangerous. You are starting to get free and leading other people to freedom. The old lies are no longer adequate.<br><br><b>So if I were your enemy, I would make you numb and distract you from God&#x2019;s story</b><br><br>Technology, social media, Netflix, travel, food and wine, comfort. I would not tempt you with notably bad things, or you would get&nbsp;suspicious. I would distract you with everyday comforts that slowly feed you a different story and make you forget God.<br><br>Then you would dismiss the Spirit leading you, loving you, and comforting you. Then you would start to love comfort more than surrender and obedience and souls.<br><br>If that didn&#x2019;t work, <b>I would attack your identity. I would make you believe you had to prove yourself.</b><br>Then you would focus on yourself instead of God. <br>Friends would become enemies. <br>Teammates would become competition. <br>You would isolate yourself and think you are not enough. <br>You would get depressed and be ungrateful for your story. <br>Or, <br>You would compare and believe you are better than others. <br>You would judge people who need God. <br>You would condemn them rather than love and invite them in. <br>You would gossip and destroy and tear down other works of God. <br>Either way you would lose your joy, because your eyes would be fixed on yourself and people instead of on Jesus.<br><br>And if that didn&#x2019;t work, <b>I would intoxicate you with the mission of God rather than God Himself.</b><br>Then you would worship a cause instead of Jesus.<br>You would fight each other to have the most important roles.<br>You would burn out from striving.<br>You would think that success is measured by the results you see.<br>You would build platforms for applause rather than to display God.<br>Then all your time and effort would be spent on becoming important rather than on knowing Jesus and loving people. The goals would be to gather followers, earn fancy job titles, publish books, build big ministries rather than to seek the souls of men and the glory of God.<br><br>And if that didn&#x2019;t work, <b>I would make you suffer. </b><br>Then maybe you would think God is evil rather than good. <br>Your faith would shrink. <br>You would get bitter and weary and tired rather than flourish and grow and become more like Christ. <br>You would try to control your life rather than step into the plans He has for you.<br><br>The enemy is telling you that freedom is only found in finally proving to yourself and to the world that . . . <br><i>you</i> are important. <br><i>you</i> are in control. <br><i>you</i> are liked. <br><i>you</i> are happy. <br><i>you</i> are enough.<br><br><b>Exposing the Lie</b><br><br>Here is the thing. The enemy promises water, but every time we go to his wells, they are empty. He gives us a sip of water, enough that we keep believing him. We have believed the lie that our cravings will be satisfied if we are enough and if we have enough. So we chase image, answers, things, people&#x2014;and we wonder all the while, Why am I still thirsty?<br><br>God is clear in the book of Jeremiah about what is happening:<br><br>My people have committed two sins: They have forsaken me, the spring of living water, and have dug their own cisterns, broken cisterns that cannot hold water.2<br><br><i>Water</i>. No human can survive three days without it. No other resource is more essential to sustain life. None.<br><br>When you look at maps of some of the most arid places in the world, you find the cities all along rivers and streams of water. <b>Where&nbsp;there is water, there is life.</b> Vegetation, animals, industry, human flourishing.<b> And in the absence of water, there is death</b>.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think you would have picked up this book if you didn&#x2019;t feel thirsty. I believe you are here because you are so thirsty you can&#x2019;t stand it anymore and you pray that maybe this time you will find living, lasting water for life. I am here because I want to fight for you to live, no longer thirsty but filled. I found water. I found rest. And I will show you where it lives.<br><br>There is water for you. Not just enough to quench your thirst but an unlimited supply that will fill you and then come pouring out of you into a thirsty world. But the water you need is found in only one Source.<br><br>I&#x2019;ll tell you right up front, there is no secret here. Just one answer to your thirst:<br><br>Jesus.<br><br>&#x201c;If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink,&#x201d; He says in the gospel of John. &#x201c;Whoever believes in me. . . streams of living water will flow from within him.&#x201d;3<br><br>He alone is the Source from which flows all the things we crave and hope to become.<br><br>I love that I can begin here, making no empty promises. Because my single goal is to lead your thirsty soul to streams of living water, to Jesus. He always delivers.<br><br>Why go here?<br><br>Practically speaking, nothing I am facing in my life changed that day on the dirt floor in Houston.

I&#x2019;ll show you how I found my way out.<br><br>Let&#x2019;s start at the beginning, when I learned to chase mirages of water in the desert . . .<br><b>Part 1 OUR DESERT OF STRIVING<br><br>1 <br><br>My Quiet Confession<br></b><br>The voice has been in my head most of my life.<br><br><i>I am not enough.</i><br><br>He hoisted me up on his lap, and my twelve-year-old scrawny legs dangled over the arm of his worn plaid recliner. Daddy is a dreamer, and this is where we dreamed. His six-foot frame easily collapsed the chair into position, and the two of us stared at the popcorn ceiling and analyzed the world together.<br><br>&#x201c;Any boys paying attention to you, Jennie?&#x201d;<br><br>I offered an obligatory giggle because that was a silly thought at twelve. Soon after, boys would become the object of my most obsessive interest, but not yet. Not only was I lanky, but my grandmother had cut my hair down to the nub only a year before. I&#x2019;m sure her intention wasn&#x2019;t as unkind as it felt. Then she cocked her head and decided it would look even better with a perm.<br><br>My elegant silver-haired grandmother and my fifth-grade self had matching hairdos.<br><br>So no, Dad. There were no boys. Well, except for Henry, whose blond mop of hair was wilder than his behavior. After my tragic fifthgrade hair incident, Henry kindly asked if my hair had been sucked off by a vacuum cleaner.<br><br>Yep. That still stings a bit.<br><br>Daddy and I dreamed and wondered. Grades. Friends. Sports. Boys. He rattled off subjects as if they were part of a secret directory of things daddies everywhere are given to ask their daughters when it becomes difficult to converse with them.<br><br>The list wasn&#x2019;t meant to catalog all his expectations; he was just checking in, helping his awkward little darting-eyed girl set goals and find her place. Mostly he was prying, though I only know it now that I&#x2019;ve parented a few twelve-year-olds of my own. He couldn&#x2019;t know that at the time, my little first-born brain was racing to assimilate the list and, with it, taking note of a line just beyond my reach. A thick black finish line that marked the place I would accomplish this growing list of imagined and unachievable expectations.<br><br>That line would wait indefinitely in the distant border of my mind, enticing me to reach it. Within me, for most of my life, would live a theory that I assumed was a fact: It was possible to arrive at a destination where I would finally prove myself. I would arrive at the line marking the place where I finally measured up to my family, my peers, my God, and my own expectations. But like the mirage in the desert, every time I thought I finally was closing in, the line backed itself up.<br><br>It all started before I was old enough to notice or be noticed by the boys, when the thought first occurred to me . . .<br><br><b>I was not enough.</b><br><br>During my freshman year at the University of Arkansas, some friends coerced me into joining them in a long line for the Razorbacks cheerleader tryouts. Obviously I was not going to make it&#x2014;I wasn&#x2019;t much of an athlete. There was the one season of soccer in first grade. Then I tried to run track one year and melodramatically yet genuinely fainted after running the 800 m in my first meet. I did take gymnastics, but I never made the cheerleading squad until my senior year of high school. I don&#x2019;t know if I wasn&#x2019;t good enough or if I made myself so nauseously nervous that I didn&#x2019;t smile. In any case, I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t make it on the college level, but it felt fun to pretend for a few days that I could.<br><br>Growing up in Arkansas, I&#x2019;d gone with my dad to all the Razorbacks games, and what did I do? I didn&#x2019;t watch the boys in pads on the field. Along with a lot of the other little girls in the stadium, I memorized every move the cheerleaders made.

But the nightmare isn&#x2019;t over. Callie wears the physical reminders of her time as a captive, and mounting evidence suggests the Thief of Souls is still out there. When a fae celebration thrusts Callie and her mate, Desmond Flynn, into the Kingdom of Flora, they take their investigation with them. But under the bright lights and striking blooms of the realm, they find there are more immediate issues to deal with. No place is more uniquely savage than the great fae halls, and no amount of bargains can save Callie from royal intrigues. Fairies play dangerous games. Some want love, some want vengeance, some want flesh, and some want things too unspeakable to utter. One thing is for sure: no one is who they appear to be. Not even Des, who only grows more enigmatic with every passing secret. But the Kingdom of Flora has its own secrets, from bleeding trees to branded slaves and missing guards. Something is stirring in the land of all that grows, and if Callie isn&#x2019;t careful, it will claim everything and everyone she loves&#x2014;and her along with it.</p><p>Found in the forest when she was young, Laura Thalassa was raised by fairies, kidnapped by werewolves, and given over to vampires as repayment for a hundred year debt.

But when little Patricia wishes on a shooting star that she could do something&#x2014;<i>anything&#x2014;</i>to show him up, she finds out just what wishes&#x2014;and rotten redheaded older brothers&#x2014;can really do.

Visit her at PatriciaPolacco.com and follow her on Facebook.PreSchool-Grade 3-Featuring an obnoxious, freckle-faced, bespectacled boy and a comforting, tale-telling grandmother, this autobiographical story is as satisfying as a warm slice of apple pie. Patricia can't quite understand how anyone could possibly like her older brother Richard. Whether picking blackberries or eating raw rhubarb, he always manages to outdo her, rubbing it in with one of his "extra-rotten, weasel-eyed, greeny-toothed grins." When their Bubbie teaches Patricia to wish on a falling star, she knows just what to ask for. The next day her wish comes true; although dizzy, she remains on the carnival merry-go-round longer than Richard. Her nemesis turns into her hero, however, when she takes a spill and he carries her home. This warm-hearted look at a typical family relationship will strike a familiar chord with siblings of all ages. The endless "can so/cannot" arguments and the girl's total exasperation make the dialogue entertaining and realistic. Bubbie's musings are more poetic, adding a sense of wonder to the everyday tone of the text. Polacco's exuberant illustrations, done in marking pens and pencil, are filled with warmth and humor. Pointing angrily at one another or quietly cuddling against Bubbie's heart, the characters are carefully posed to reflect the story's varying moods. Barnyard animals provide an amusing backdrop to the children's antics, puckering their faces at the sour rhubarb and smiling sweetly at a tender moment. Black-and-white photographs of Patricia and Richie at different ages are scattered across the endpapers, adding the final touch to this endearing reminiscence.<br><i> Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I Spy - Animals!: A Fun Guessing Game for 2-4 Year Olds (I Spy Book Collection for Kids)</h2><p><b> NEW AND IMPROVED with even more animals! </b> <br>Can you spot the animal that begins with G?

Over the years, more than two dozen books have been published by the magazine's editors.Golden Rules<br><br>1. Take it to the next level.<br><br>The recipes in this book make ordinary cookies absolutely extraordinary. Whether a classic with a twist, like the Tahini Cookies (page 00) and the Key Lime Sabl�s (page 00), or an embellished creation, like the Cherry Blossom Cookies (page 00) and the Birch Bark Tuiles (page 00), these treats will introduce you to new flavors, textures, and techniques. We utilized equipment that isn&#x2019;t traditionally used for cookies (think madeleine pans and meat mallets), tried new toppings, and tested unusual flavor combinations for old favorites. But above all, we made sure every cookie was delicious. <br><br>2. Be prepared.<br><br>To avoid any surprises, read through the recipe before getting started, and have your ingredients measured and prepped. Does the butter need to be at room temperature or melted? Should the nuts be toasted and the chocolate chopped? Have you measured the dry ingredients? A good mise en place ensures a smooth baking process.<br><br>3. Get to know your oven.<br><br>All ovens are different and may vary in temperature, so it&#x2019;s smart to keep a stand-alone thermometer in the oven for accuracy. Since most cookies are small and don&#x2019;t bake for very long, you should set a timer and also keep an eye out for other doneness cues. Some cookies should be dry and firm to the touch, others golden at the edges or just barely set.<br><br>4. Set up the racks.<br><br>For one sheet of cookies, place the rack in the center of the oven. If baking two sheets at a time, racks should be in the upper and lower thirds. Halfway through the baking time, rotate the sheets top to bottom and turn them front to back to ensure even baking.<br><br>5. Line the baking sheets.<br><br>Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone baking mats for easy cleanup and even baking. They provide some insulation and can prevent scorching on the bottom of your cookies.<br><br>6. Take time to chill. <br><br>If a recipe calls for chilling the cookie dough, don&#x2019;t skip this important step, as it will affect the final outcome. (Be sure to factor chilling and resting into your total baking time.) Chilling keeps butter solid, so the dough is less likely to spread during baking. It also concentrates flavor, allowing the sugar time to absorb more liquid. You&#x2019;ll have more golden-colored cookies with chewy, crispy spots throughout. <br><br>7. Store your cookies properly.<br><br>Let the cookies cool completely before storing, as trapped heat will make the cookies soggy, and layer them between waxed paper or parchment so they don&#x2019;t stick together. Crunchy cookies and soft cookies shouldn&#x2019;t be stored in the same container; the crisp ones will absorb the moisture from the others and lose their snap. Most cookies will keep for about three days, some are best the day of, and a few can keep for weeks or even improve over time, such as shortbread and biscotti&#x2014;if they last that long.<br><br><b>1<br><br>All Dressed Up</b><br><br>Trading in the everyday for something far more special, these cookies take it to the next level in shape, color, and flavor. They&#x2019;re frosted, dusted, swirled, and embellished&#x2014;thoroughly dressed to impress.<br><br><b>Pastel Butter Cookies</b><br><br>Makes 40<br><br>To give a batch of almond shortbread cookies the pastel treatment, dust them with tinted confectioners&#x2019; sugar. We blended the sugar with finely ground freeze-dried fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and mango) for subtle, all-natural hues. <br><br>1 cup whole blanched almonds, toasted<br>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour<br>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt<br>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, room temperature<br>1 cup confectioners&#x2019; sugar, sifted, plus more for pastel sugars<br>1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>Freeze-dried fruits in various colors, such as blueberries, raspberries, and mangoes<br><br><b>1.</b> Preheat oven to 350�F. Place toasted almonds in the bowl of a food processor. Add flour, salt, and cinnamon, and process until nuts are finely ground, about 1 minute.<br><br><b>2. </b>In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer on medium, beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add vanilla and beat until combined. With mixer on low, gradually add almond mixture and beat until just incorporated.<br><br><b>3.</b> Using a 11/2-inch (1-tablespoon) cookie scoop, drop dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing about 1 inch apart. Bake, rotating halfway through, until edges are just turning golden, 14 to 16 minutes. Transfer sheets to a wire rack and let cool completely.<br><br><b>4.</b> For each desired color, place 1/2 cup fruit with 1/2 cup confectioners&#x2019; sugar in the bowl of a food processor; process until smooth and evenly tinted. (Sugars can be stored in airtight containers up to 1 month.) Place tinted sugars in small bowls and dip cookies, domed-side down, into tinted sugars to coat. Transfer to a plate and let rest, about 30 minutes. (Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.)<br><br><b>TIP</b><br>We used natural food coloring from freeze-dried fruits (found in the snack section of large grocery stores) to decorate these cookies, but for a broader palette of colors, look for the array of pastel powdered sugars at specialty baking stores.</p><h2>Spirit of the Animals Oracle</h2><p>This magnificent oracle by Jody Bergsma will guide you on a journey to get to know 51 different animal helpers and discover their powerful medicine.

A powerful nature story for a young audience." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>Far, far out at sea lives one of the world's most mysterious creatures, the loggerhead turtle. For thirty years she swims the oceans, wandering thousands of miles as she searches for food. Then, one summer night, she lands on a beach to lay her eggs &#x2014; the very same beach where she herself was born. Nicola Davies's lyrical text offers fascinating information about the journey of the tiny, endangered loggerhead, while charming paintings by Jane Chapman vividly illustrate one turtle's odyssey.</p><p>Nicola Davies has loved sea turtles ever since she first saw one in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Nicola Davies is also the author of BIG BLUE WHALE, BAT LOVES THE NIGHT, and WILD ABOUT DOLPHINS.<br><br>Jane Chapman also loves sea turtles and has wanted to paint them for ages. Her other books for children include ONE DUCK STUCK by Phyllis Root and THE EMPEROR'S EGG by Martin Jenkins, a National Science Teachers Association - Children's Book Council Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children.K-Gr 2-This nicely developed picture-book introduction to the loggerhead turtle sketches the life experiences of a typical female through text and broad acrylic views. The author exhibits a flair for alliteration and imagery in her descriptive narrative about this sea animal: "Just beneath the surface is a tangle of weed and driftwood where tiny creatures cling. This is the nursery of a sea turtle." Several pages follow the creature's early period and departure for the larger sea, and then the years of growth and travel are skimmed until her eventual return to the beach of her birth to lay her own eggs. On many pages curving lines of smaller type add bits of explanation, augmenting the story line. The double-spread paintings, occasionally alternating with smaller pictures set on aqua pages, focus on the turtle, with a few water plants suggesting underwater detail. A fine bed of blue crabs on which the turtle feasts is the only view of other animals sharing the ocean habitat until a concluding beach scenario where gulls and crabs threaten the newly hatched turtles who are starting the cycle anew. A very brief introduction identifies this turtle as a loggerhead. Gail Gibbons's Sea Turtles (Holiday, 1995) and Brenda Guiberson's Into the Sea (Holt, l995) offer young readers more information on this interesting animal. Broadly sketched in good language and pictures for read-aloud sharing, Davies's title will be enjoyed as a glimpse into the ways of the remarkable giant sea turtles.<p></p><p><i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Archidoodle: The Architect&#39;s Activity Book</h2><p>This innovative book is the first to provide a fun, interactive way to learn about architecture.

When she is young, Elfie is full of pep and pranks; but as her master grows taller and taller, Elfie grows fatter and slower. One morning Elfie does not wake up. The family grieves and buries her, and the boy refuses a new puppy. He is not yet ready for another pet; but when he is, he will tell that one, as he told Elsie every night, "I'll always love you." The watercolor illustrations, tender and warm in color and mood and cozily rounded in form, suit the simple text perfectly.

It was cited as a Best Book of the Year by <em>Atlanta</em> magazine, the <em>Tampa Tribune</em>, the <em>St. Louis Post Dispatch</em>, and the <em>Village Voice</em>, to name but a few. Award-winning, #1<em> New York Times</em> bestselling Neil Gaiman of <em>The Sandman</em>, <em>The Graveyard Book</em>, and <em>Anansi Boys</em> fame calls Joe Hill&#x2019;s story of a jaded rock star haunted by a ghost he purchased on the internet, &#x201c;relentless, gripping, powerful.&#x201d; Open this <em>Heart-Shaped Box</em> from two-time Bram Stoker Award-winner Hill if you dare and see what all the well-deserved hoopla is about.<br></p><p>Aging death-metal rock legend Judas Coyne is a collector of the macabre: a cookbook for cannibals...a used hangman's noose...a snuff film.

And now everywhere Judas Coyne goes, the old man is there&#x2014;watching, waiting, dangling a razor blade on a chain from his bony hand.<br></p></p><p>Do you sleep with the light on? Are you in the habit of checking your doors and windows before you go to bed? Maybe even checking <i>under</i> your bed? If you are about to crack open Joe Hill's chilling thriller <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, you might want to rethink your nighttime habits--Hill's story about an aging rock star (with a penchant for macabre artifacts) who buys a haunted suit online will scare you silly. But don't take our word for it. We asked bestselling authors (and masters of dark terror tales themselves) Scott Smith, and Harlan Coben to read <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> and give us their take. Check out their reviews below, and you might want to pick up a nightlight while you're at it. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Scott Smith</strong><br><br><b>In 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with his stunning debut thriller, <i>A Simple Plan</i>. Thirteen years later, he spooked us again with <i>The Ruins</i>, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle.</b> <br><br> The set-up for Joe Hill's novel, <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, is appealingly simple. Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man's suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man's ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he's wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. "Watch" is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill's prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude's world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book's otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.<p> Hill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it's not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might've written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death's "night road" in a '65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.</p><p> The story's horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne's past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book's bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It's this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it's what makes Hill's debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open his <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>. I think you&#x2019;ll be happy you did. <i>--Scott Smith</i><br> </p></td> <td> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Harlan Coben</strong><br><br><b>Harlan Coben is the author of the beloved Myron Bolitar series about a wisecracking sports agent, as well as stunning stand-alone novels like <i>The Innocent</i> and his breakout thriller <i>Tell No One</i>. His new novel <i>The Woods</i> releases on April 17, 2007.</b> <br><br> You, dear reader, are obviously somewhat versed in making online purchases, so today, immediately after you click on the yellow "Add to Shopping Cart" on the top right hand corner of this page, why not do an online search and buy something totally unique?<p> Like, say, a vengeful ghost.</p><p> That is what rock-star Judas Coyne does, thinking it will be a laugh, fun for his "sick-o" collection of such things. It seems a random buy, but Judas soon learns that it is anything but. This particular ghost is one Craddock McDermott, step-father to recent suicide victim and boy, is he cranky. He demands revenge for his step-daughter&#x2019;s death, which he blames on Judas&#x2019;s shabby treatment of her.</p><p> Or is he after something else?</p><p> There are Amazon readers who will give you a better plot summary. Don't read them too closely because Joe Hill provides plenty of fun surprises. <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> is a true spine-tingler. I don&#x2019;t use that hyphenated word much anymore. We have seen and read it all, haven't we? But right away, in the first chapter, there was a subtle line that made the hairs on the back of my neck go up in a way I haven't experienced since I first discovered great horror as a teenager.</p><p> Hill writes with a sure hand. The prose is compelling. Like most memorable tales of horror, this book is more about redemption than scary moments--though <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> has plenty of scares. They are visceral, shocking and very well done. The characters are flawed and real. The father-son relationship adds texture and surprising poignancy.</p><p> So here's the thing. My guess is, you won&#x2019;t find a ghost to buy online, but if you read the <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, you will be getting something that will haunt you and startle you and stay with you and yes, visit you in your dreams.</p><p> Sleep well, dear reader. <i>--Harlan Coben<br> </i></p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p><p>Aging death-metal rock legend Judas Coyne is a collector of the macabre: a cookbook for cannibals...a used hangman's noose...a snuff film.

This luxurious box set includes a pullout tray with a complete set of seven vintage vineyard maps by Louis Larmat, a rare and indispensable resource that beautifully documents the region&#x2019;s terroirs. With extensive grower and vintner profiles, as well as a fascinating look at Champagne&#x2019;s history and lore, <i>Champagne</i> explores this legendary wine as never before.</p><p>PETER LIEM is an American wine writer and the author of ChampagneGuide.net. Following nearly a decade in the wine trade, he was a senior editor, critic, and tasting director for <i>Wine &amp; Spirits</i>, and his writings on sherry, champagne, and other wines have also appeared in publications such as <i>The World of Fine Wine</i>, <i>The Art of Eating,</i> and <i>The San Francisco Chronicle.</i>INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br> I enjoyed my fair share of champagne as a young wine professional, but the first magical champagne, the one that really pushed the boundaries of what I thought champagne could be, was the 1979 Salon. I tasted it in 1996 at the wine store in San Francisco where I worked: we were selling the 1979 for $99, which was expensive for the time, but not nearly as prohibitively priced as the same bottle would be today.<br><br>Most champagnes are blended wines, which offer a multifaceted harmony, with diverse components coming together to create a complex whole. In contrast, the Salon, which comes exclusively from one village&#x2014;Le Mesnil-sur-Oger&#x2014;felt distinctly narrower in scope yet no less complete. Tasting it, I immediately knew it was different than any champagne I&#x2019;d had before, and I was filled with questions: Where was Le Mesnil? Why did its wine taste this way? Did all Le Mesnil champagnes taste like this? And perhaps even more importantly, if the Salon was indicative of Le Mesnil, what did champagnes from other villages taste like?<br><br>***<br><br> The contemporary movement in Champagne is more than the rise of grower estates, or the reduction of dosage, or the creation of single-vineyard wines, or the practice of organic and biodynamic viticulture. All these things are emblematic of Champagne today, yet they are reflective of a larger transformation, which is, rather simply, the acknowledgment of champagne as a wine like any other. While both consumers and producers were content in the recent past to treat champagne as a brand, or as an object of lifestyle, or as an entity in the wine world that was somehow less serious than Burgundy or Barolo, the prevailing attitudes have shifted, at least in the arenas that matter. Champagne is now subject to the same questions asked of any other wine and held to the same standards&#x2014;and now that it&#x2019;s being held accountable, it must provide satisfactory answers.<br><br>One of the primary functions of a truly fine wine, no matter where it comes from, is to say something about the place where it was grown. Terroir is a subject that hasn&#x2019;t been adequately explored in Champagne, and yet, it plays a fundamental role in the creation of the wine&#x2019;s character, just as it does in any other wine region. It&#x2019;s for this reason that I&#x2019;ve focused on terroir as the theme of this book.<br><br>It is still not yet possible to write a comprehensive analysis of Champagne&#x2019;s terroir, given the lack of tools and information available compared with other historic regions. However, it&#x2019;s my hope that this book can in some small way help to push the dialogue further toward acknowledging champagne as a terroir-expressive wine, and to provide a foundation for envisioning that. The complexities of that discussion are still to be revealed as champagne continues to evolve, and that is part of what makes Champagne such an exciting wine region today.</p><h2>Blockchain Bubble or Revolution: The Future of Bitcoin, Blockchains, and Cryptocurrencies</h2><p><p>Some experts say that cryptocurrencies and blockchains are just a scam; others say they&#x2019;re &#x201c;the most important invention since the internet.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s hard to tell who&#x2019;s right. <b>Authored by Product Managers from Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, <i>Bubble or Revolution</i> cuts through the hype to offer a balanced, comprehensive, and accessible analysis of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.</b></p><br><p>You&#x2019;ll learn the core concepts of these technologies and understand their strengths and weaknesses from real-world case studies; dive deep into their technical, economic, political, and legal complexities; and gain insights about their future from exclusive interviews with dozens of tech industry leaders.

Part memoir, part master class by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer&#x2019;s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. King&#x2019;s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999&#x2014;and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, <i>On Writing</i> will empower and entertain everyone who reads it&#x2014;fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p><p>Short and snappy as it is, Stephen King's <i>On Writing</i> really contains two books: a fondly sardonic autobiography and a tough-love lesson for aspiring novelists. The memoir is terrific stuff, a vivid description of how a writer grew out of a misbehaving kid. You're right there with the young author as he's tormented by poison ivy, gas-passing babysitters, uptight schoolmarms, and a laundry job nastier than Jack London's. It's a ripping yarn that casts a sharp light on his fiction. This was a child who dug Yvette Vickers from <i>Attack of the Giant Leeches</i>, not Sandra Dee. "I wanted monsters that ate whole cities, radioactive corpses that came out of the ocean and ate surfers, and girls in black bras who looked like trailer trash." But massive reading on all literary levels was a craving just as crucial, and soon King was the published author of "I Was a Teen-Age Graverobber." As a young adult raising a family in a trailer, King started a story inspired by his stint as a janitor cleaning a high-school girls locker room. He crumpled it up, but his writer wife retrieved it from the trash, and using her advice about the girl milieu and his own memories of two reviled teenage classmates who died young, he came up with <i>Carrie</i>. King gives us lots of revelations about his life and work. The kidnapper character in <i>Misery</i>, the mind-possessing monsters in <i>The Tommyknockers</i>, and the haunting of the blocked writer in <i>The Shining</i> symbolized his cocaine and booze addiction (overcome thanks to his wife's intervention, which he describes). "There's one novel, <i>Cujo</i>, that I barely remember writing." <p> King also evokes his college days and his recovery from the van crash that nearly killed him, but the focus is always on what it all means to the craft. He gives you a whole writer's "tool kit": a reading list, writing assignments, a corrected story, and nuts-and-bolts advice on dollars and cents, plot and character, the basic building block of the paragraph, and literary models. He shows what you can learn from H.P. Lovecraft's arcane vocabulary, Hemingway's leanness, Grisham's authenticity, Richard Dooling's artful obscenity, Jonathan Kellerman's sentence fragments. He explains why <i>Hart's War</i> is a great story marred by a tin ear for dialogue, and how Elmore Leonard's <i>Be Cool</i> could be the antidote. </p><p> King isn't just a writer, he's a true teacher. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation,</i> <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy, <i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Probably has something to do with being so close to the canyon. Having a mile-deep hole in your backyard brings out the weirdness in folks. </p><p> I remember the time that gambler from L.A. lost a bet in Las Vegas, and his friends drove him up here. Forced him to parachute into the canyon. Guy almost died. You get all kinds in this part of the country. The canyon attracts 'em like flies to dog doo. But this recent situation involving the children was one of the stranger cases I ever ran into. </p><p> We called in everybody who had anything to do with what happened and taped their private testimony for the record. Far as I'm concerned, this case is closed and shut. Let's hope these four kids learned their lesson. This'll never happen again, that's for darn sure. </p><p> Copyright �2006 by Dan Gutman </p><p> <b>Chapter One</b></p><p> September </p><p> <b>Sam Dawkins, grade 5</b> </p><p> The police lady says me and Brenton and Judy and Kelsey have to each come in separately and talk about what happened. </p><p> Okay, so here goes. Is this thing on? My name is Sam Dawkins, but everybody calls me Snikwad on account of that's my last name spelled backward. Dawkins. Snikwad. Get it? Most kids call me "Snik." It's kinda cool. Beats having a nickname like Booger Face or Fart Boy or something stupid like that. </p><p> I was new to the school. I didn't know anything. And I didn't get kicked out of my old school because I refused to get a haircut. That's a lie. I don't know how that rumor got started. I don't care if you believe me. That's the truth. Anyway, my parents moved here from Oregon. My dad was in the air force and that's why we moved to Arizona. He was assigned to Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix. </p><p> The bottom line is, we messed up. Stuff happens. We're not perfect. We all feel bad. We won't do it again. What are you gonna do, throw us in jail? That's my statement. </p><p> What, you need more than that? Details? Okay, okay. What do you want to know? </p><p> <b>Kelsey Donnelly, grade 5</b> </p><p> My name is Kelsey Donnelly. I really don't see the reason why we gotta do this. The police lady told me that I have to make a "statement" in private and tell the whole story of what happened from the very beginning in September. Like I'm a creep or something! I barely remember what happened last week. Forget about way back in September. </p><p> Look, we're sorry about what happened. We were just having a little fun and it got out of hand. It's not like we robbed a bank or anything. That's my statement. I can't believe I have to spend my summer in this room with a tape recorder when I could be out having fun. Can I go now? </p><p> <b>Judy Douglas, grade 5</b> </p><p> My name is Judy Douglas. My mom works at home and my dad works for the National Park Service. He cuts down dead trees and does controlled burns to prevent forest fires. </p><p> The whole thing started because certain people who shall remain nameless did some thoughtless things that I don't need to discuss here. </p><p> This is so unfair. I have almost straight A's and I'm in the G&amp;T program. That's gifted and talented. I would never break the law or do anything dishonest. Things just got out of control. The next thing we knew, we had to go talk to the police. </p><p> Do you have any idea of how humiliating this entire ordeal has been for me? Do you know how upset my parents were when they found out? And now this is going to be on my permanent record, probably for the rest of my life. If this keeps me out of law school someday, I will be so angry. </p><p> I'll sue. That's what I'll do. Well, if I get into law school I'll sue. But if I get into law school I won't need to sue. Oh, I just wish I could go to sleep and wake up and find out it was all a dream. Like it never happened. </p><p> <b>Judy's mom</b> </p><p> My first reaction was that it was discrimination. We are one of the few African-American families living in this area. When something bad happens to Judy, I can't help but wonder if it is bigotry at work. But I looked into it, and that wasn't the case. She and the others just did a dumb thing and they got caught. It's as simple as that. And now they're going to have to pay for it. </p><p> <b>Brenton Damagatchi, grade 5</b> </p><p> It's interesting how things happen sometimes. If I line up ten dominoes and I push over the first one, the others will fall one by one. But if I leave the first one alone, the other dominoes remain standing. </p><p> Life is like that. The way your life plays out depends on which dominoes you choose to push over and which ones you leave alone. In this case, we pushed over the wrong domino. Can I get a drink of water or something? </p><p> <b>Miss Rasmussen, fifth-grade teacher</b> </p><p> I was so excited, walking into my very own classroom for the first time in September. I had been a student teacher in Ohio, and I was hoping to get a job somewhere in the west, preferably near a national park. I've always been a nature lover, and I wanted to share this with young people. When I got an offer to teach fifth grade at the Grand Canyon School, well, it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. </p><p> The Grand Canyon! I had never even been here before. Just think! Over the course of four billion years, the Colorado River slowly sliced this gash into the Earth. I spent hours exploring it when I moved here, and took lots of pictures of the layers of rock. The Grand Canyon is like a sculpture, created by nature. I was in awe. </p><p> <b>Judy Douglas, grade 5</b> </p><p> When I walked into Miss Rasmussen's class on the first day of school, the first thing that struck me was that she was so young! I mean, she looked like she could have been one of the students. I liked that, because I figured she would be really enthusiastic about everything. Some of the older teachers who have been teaching all their lives don't get too excited about anything anymore. </p><p> On the other hand, I was afraid Miss Rasmussen might not be experienced enough to handle some of the boys, who can be a problem sometimes. </p><p> <b>Sam Dawkins, grade 5</b> </p><p> So I walk into Miss Rasmussen's class on the first day of school in September and I'm the new kid, so I'm a little nervous and I don't want everybody looking at me, but they're all looking at me anyway because, well, I'm the new kid and everybody wants to check out the new kid. </p><p> I scope out the scene and it's obvious who the cool kids are, who the dumb kids are, who the smart kids are, and who the dorks are. I could tell in a minute. The class had the usual number of clueless dweebs, pre-jock idiots, losers, brownnosers, and bullies, just like my old school. </p><p> But the one kid who stood out was Brenton. You just knew the first time you set eyes on him that there was something different about this kid. </p><p> <b>Judy Douglas, grade 5</b> </p><p> Brenton would dress funny, with these stiff long pants no matter how hot it was. He always wore a button-down shirt and sometimes he would even wear a tie to school. Can you imagine? I guess his mom made him dress that way. I hope so, anyway. I can't imagine a boy wearing a tie to school on his own. He was actually pretty good-looking, but he combed his hair in a really weird way. Like he parted it on the wrong side or something. </p><p> Once I suggested to him that he would look better if he combed his hair the other way. He just looked at me like I was crazy. Like it hadn't even occurred to him that you could change your personal appearance to look better. Or that it would matter. He probably had so many more important things on his mind that he couldn't be bothered with something as trivial as combing his hair. </p><p> Some of the other kids would make fun of him behind his back. Sometimes in front of his back. He didn't have any friends. Nobody seemed to know what to make of him. </p><p> <b>Sam Dawkins, grade 5</b> </p><p> Brenton just came out and said the weirdest stuff. Like one time he comes up to me and asks me if I know what they made glass out of. I say no and he says they make glass out of sand. I say that's interesting, even though I really don't think it's all that interesting. Then he gets that look in his eyes and he says they take sand and make it into glass. He says he figures that if they can turn sand into glass, just about anything is possible. I'm telling you, the guy is different. </p><p> <b>Kelsey Donnelly, grade 5</b> </p><p> Brenton was a genius when it came to school and stuff, but he was real stupid when it came to other stuff. I remember one time this reality TV show was hot and everybody was talking about it. I mean everybody. And we were all at recess talking about it and Brenton comes out and says something like, "I never heard of that show." We all just looked at him. It was like not knowing the sun was in the sky. And they say I'm dumb! </p><p> That's just the way Brenton is. He doesn't know or care about the stuff that normal people care about. We all thought he was a dork. Well, probably Judy didn't, 'cause she's a genius too. </p><p> <b>Sam Dawkins, grade 5</b> </p><p> Most kids at least try to act cool in some way. You know, like they'll get T-shirts with cool logos on them or they'll get a cool bike or listen to cool music. They may not be cool themselves, but they make themselves cool by having cool stuff or hanging around with cool people. But Brenton, he didn't even make the effort. </p><p> <b>Brenton Damagatchi, grade 5</b> </p><p> What does "cool" mean, anyway? Did you know that Abraham Lincoln once said "That is cool"? It's true. I looked it up. He said it in his famous Cooper Union speech. Google it if you don't believe me. </p><p> I feel that a person can change himself or herself no more than a giraffe can decide it doesn't like having a long neck. It would be easy enough to buy the latest clothes and watch the hot new TV shows and surround myself with cool things. But that wouldn't make me cool. Nothing will ever make me cool. Some people are simply destined not to be cool. And I'm cool with that. </p><p> If everybody was cool, everybody would b...</p></p><h2>The Candy Smash (The Lemonade War Series) (The Lemonade War Series, 4)</h2><p><p>Jessie and Evan Treski have waged a lemonade war, sought justice in a class trial, and even unmasked a bell thief.

After escaping to the North in 1838, as a free man he gave powerful speeches about his experience as a slave. He was so impressive that he became a friend of President Abraham Lincoln, as well as one of the most famous abolitionists of the nineteenth century.</p><p>April Jones Prince is the author of several children's books, including <i>Who Was Mark Twain?</i><p></p><p>Who Was Frederick Douglass?</p><p>Frederick Douglass was born a slave.

Wasn&#x2019;t he as smart, strong, and deserving of liberty as anyone else?</p><p>At the time Frederick was born, in 1818, there were 1.5 million black slaves in the southern United States.

In Colors, some spreads incorporate a single object such as an apple or flower, while others use the same shape to depict two different objects. For example, an orange sunset on the left and an orange slice on the right are both created out of the same semicircle. However, it should be noted that the shade of orange used is not easily distinguished from the red on the preceding page. Typical couplings such as "Outside/Inside," "Night/Day," and "Small/Big" are included in Opposites, along with more peculiar pairings such as "Caged/Free," showing a tearful lion behind bars on one side and the bars lifted on the other. Some of the opposites that might not come naturally to young children include "Heavy [an elephant]/Light [a cloud]." The motto of these French imports is "to touch is to experience; to experience is to learn." Children will certainly be drawn to the bright, appealing, and touchable illustrations, but the flaws in the execution of the concepts make the books additional purchases.-Rachel Kamin, North Suburban Synagogue Beth El, Highland Park, IL&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2013.

His golf-specific approach to helping players develop and strengthen their Golf Body has made him the winningest biomechanics coach in the history of the PGA Tour. From golfing legend Vijay Singh to today&#39;s young stars like Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Rickie Fowler and Keegan Bradley have benefitted from his expertise in the fields of biomechanics and golf fitness. When he&#39;s not on the road working with players, he&#39;s at the Joey D Golf Sports Training Center in Jupiter, Florida.<p>1 Who Is Joey D.?</p><p>or... Why Are You Reading This Book?</p><p>Joey D.,&#x201c; Vijay Singh said with a giant smile on his face. &#x201c;You sounded taller over the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>The first time I met Vijay Singh, he insulted me. I instantly liked him.</p><p>This was back in 2001. He&#x2019;d heard some good things about me and thought maybe something about this unorthodox golf coach with some unorthodox training methods could help him take his game to the next level. Vijay and I worked together for a few months, and in March 2002 he notched his first tour victory in almost two years by winning the Shell Houston Open by a comfortable six strokes.</p><p>He invited me to fly back to Ponte Vedra, Florida, with him on his plane.</p><p>&#x201c;What would it take to get you to work with me exclusively?&#x201d; he asked me. Before I could even start to consider the offer, he added, &#x201c;I know I can be the best player in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>In 2002, everyone just assumed that Tiger Woods was invincible and would be number one in the world for as long as the sport of golf interested him. Vijay Singh was a PGA Tour Rookie of the Year in 1993, but had managed just a single tour win since 2000. Here he was, though, telling me that he thought he could be number one. Most people would have laughed at his prediction, but I knew how hard a worker he was. In the time I had been with him, he&#x2019;d just about kill himself whenever we worked out. I respected his work ethic immensely, but I also knew that trying to overtake Tiger would be going up against some stiff odds. I knew something about facing insurmountable odds, though.</p><p>I sold my training facility in south Florida and moved north to Ponte Vedra.</p><p>In September 2004, Vijay outshot Tiger Woods and Adam Scott by three strokes to win the Deutsche Bank Championship in Norton, Massachusetts. As a result, he leapfrogged over Tiger and into the number one spot in the world. Thanks to hard work and a team of dedicated and knowledgeable professionals, Vijay had made good on his prediction. In April 2005, when he was elected into the World Golf Hall of Fame, Vijay thanked several people in his acceptance speech. I was one of them. I sometimes wonder what it was that made me uproot my life to go work with him, and I always come back to what he said to me on that flight from Texas: &#x201c;I know I can be the best player in the world.&#x201d;</p><p>Something about his confidence and determination reminded me of someone.</p><p>NEW JERSEY</p><p>As a kid, I would never accept anything but 100 percent of myself. I played football in junior leagues and developmental leagues, and I recognized early on that I was stronger and faster than the other kids. Physically, I was pretty lucky in my genetics. But mentally, I just approached the game differently from my friends. The way I thought about things was completely different from anybody else&#x2019;s. I&#x2019;d see things that no one else saw. I recognized I was a leader because I had no fear of anything at all. That could have been a good thing or a bad thing, but it made me relentless in just about anything I did.</p><p>I never wanted anyone to drive me to football practice, for example. I wanted to ride my bike to practice because, I used to think, if I rode my bike, I would already be ahead of the curve when I got there. And if we didn&#x2019;t win a game, I would come completely unglued. Everybody would leave to do whatever they did after a game, and I would just stay there doing drills and running for hours. I grew up in Manalapan, New Jersey&#x2014;a typical suburb in Monmouth County. In the late summer, I knew that football season was right around the corner, and I would run up and down the hills. It&#x2019;d be light out when I started, and eventually the sun would go down and it would be dark and I&#x2019;d still be running. It&#x2019;d be nine at night and I&#x2019;d still be out there. I used to tell myself, &#x201c;I need to be faster. I need to be in better shape than anybody else when I get to the first day of practice.&#x201d;</p><p>When the season started, I was always in the best shape I could possibly be in. Couple this with my natural skills, and I was a monster on the field. They&#x2019;d put me on the bench after the first half because I was destroying people. Opposing coaches constantly questioned my age, saying I had to have been much older than I said I was.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure where this extreme work ethic came from. I come from an average middle-class family. Everybody worked and everyone had this dream and vision to better himself. You were taught from the beginning that hard work was the key to success&#x2014;on the field, in the classroom, everywhere. My dad was demanding about grades. If I wasn&#x2019;t on the honor roll, I couldn&#x2019;t play any sports. It drove me to understand the importance of education. And since I was so driven about getting in the best shape I could be in, it was natural for me to start learning as much as I could about how the body worked.</p><p>From a young age, I started studying what I could do to make myself a better athlete. I knew it was more than just pure strength&#x2014;more than just how much I could bench-press or how much I could squat. Being an athlete was about knowing how to use that strength in motion. The strongest guy on the field is just the strongest guy on the field unless he knows how to use that strength in the particular sport that he&#x2019;s playing. By then, I had branched out from just playing football. I had started wrestling and began studying martial arts. I was continually amazed at how these lighter-weight-class wrestlers and my martial arts instructors&#x2014;at maybe 130 pounds&#x2014;could do these incredible things with their bodies. They generated the same amount of strength and power and explosiveness as much bigger guys. I started to become obsessed with figuring out where this ability came from. How could these small individuals have this power and transfer it through movement and have such amazing results? In my head, I began to think about how these movements and movement patterns could be applied to other sports with similar results. That&#x2019;s when I started to really understand movement strength.</p><p>Unfortunately, both my research and my football career were about to be put on hold.</p><p>SETBACKS</p><p>Two months before my eighteenth birthday, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. A biopsy later revealed that the cancer had spread and had developed into lymphatic cancer. Despite all the work I had put into my training and into my body, I had a terminal disease. I saw a ton of doctors and surgeons, and at the end of most of these visits, someone in a white coat with a serious expression on his or her face would ask me what I&#x2019;d like to do with the next&#x2014;and final&#x2014;ten months of my life. All of a sudden, at eighteen years old, everything I had ever dreamed about was gone. It was surreal. All of these specialists were telling me that I was going to die, but I still felt great. I felt as if I could run through walls.</p><p>I approached my sickness the way I&#x2019;d approached just about everything else up to that point in my life. Because of who I was, I wasn&#x2019;t simply going to lie down. I couldn&#x2019;t. It just wasn&#x2019;t part of my makeup. Eventually, I found a doctor who was willing to take a chance on surgery. He told me about an invasive and difficult procedure. He said he was willing to try it because he was convinced I was strong enough to handle it. I thought back to the long and painful hours I&#x2019;d spent in the gym and running those hills. All that time I thought I had been training for football.</p><p>Then the real game began. I went into the hospital and they did all of these extensive tests and scheduled me for major surgery. They told me that the procedure would take a certain number of hours, but when they went in, they found a lot more problems than they expected. I was fighting for my life. I made it through the surgery, but no one was sure if they got all of the cancer or if it had spread somewhere else.</p><p>Chemotherapy treatments started and the months started to go by. At the time, chemo wasn&#x2019;t outpatient for most people. I had to be in the hospital seven or ten days at a time. Over a year and a half, I went from a ferocious 218-pound teenager that was going to take the football world apart to an emaciated 140-pound kid. On top of the weight loss, the chemo affected all of my senses. I lost all of my senses. I had no sense of taste. I had no sense of feeling. I had no strength. I was sick constantly. It was a nightmare. But I survived.</p><p>Call it destiny, the work of God, what ever. I don&#x2019;t want to get caught up in all of that. My personal belief is that it wasn&#x2019;t really my time to go. With a clean bill of health, I now had to rebuild what was left of my body. I spent the next eighteen months strengthening and reteaching my muscles how to do the things that they used to do so effortlessly and naturally. My body bounced back. (If you&#x2019;re a collector of old muscle magazines, which would immediately make me very suspect of you, check out the August 1991 issue of Robert Kennedy&#x2019;s Muscle Mag International. It has a feature on me and my illness, recovery, and subsequent success as a trainer.) At age twenty-two, I had fought back and conquered a terminal illness. My dream of playing college or pro football, though, was gone.</p><p>SOUTH FLORIDA</p><p>In the mideighties, I moved down to West Palm Beach. I figured that if I had built&#x2014;and then rebuilt&#x2014;my body using principles I&#x2019;d developed, it was time to see how these theories worked on other people. I&#x2019;d helped out people in the gym all of my life, but Florida would give me access to a different breed of client&#x2014;the pro athlete. A lot of NBA and NFL guys spend their off-seasons down there, and with around half of the Major League Baseball teams doing their spring training in the surrounding areas, it just seemed like the place to be. The challenge was getting the first few athletes to understand and believe in what I was doing. Once they saw how th...</p></p><h2>Ralph Lauren: In His Own Fashion</h2><p><b>A fully illustrated biography of iconic American designer Ralph Lauren told through the lens of fashion&nbsp;</b><br><br> From the author of <i>Dressing the Man</i>, the seminal tome on men&#x2019;s fashion, comes the illustrated biography of Ralph Lauren.

All her life she has taken on every responsibility, assumed every burden, granted every request. Claire wants it all--and in the eyes of her friends, she has it: a devoted husband, four beautiful children, even a successful career as an artist. So when she agrees to chair the committe for Nantucket's social event of the year, she knows she can handle it. Claire can handle anything.<br>But when planning the gala propels her into the orbit of billionaire Lock Dixon, unexpected sparks begin to fly. Lock insists on working closely with Claire--often over a bottle of wine--and before long she can't ignore the subtle touches and lingering looks. To her surprise, she can't ignore how they make her feel, either. Claire finds the gala, her life, and herself spinning out of control.<br><i>A Summer Affair</i> captures the love, loss, and limbo of an illicit romance and unchecked passion as it takes us on a brave and breathless journey into the heart of one modern woman.<br></p><p>Elin Hilderbrand lives on Nantucket with her husband and their three young children. She grew up in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, and traveled extensively before settling on Nantucket, which has been the setting for her six previous novels. Hilderbrand is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the graduate fiction workshop at the University of Iowa.Hilderbrand's seventh novel delves into the psyche of a guilt-ridden mother/artist who embarks on a self-destructive path. Nantucket glass artist Claire Danner Crispin has pieces in private collections and one in the Whitney, but is overwhelmed with the needs of her husband and four kids (she gave up full-time glassblowing to take care of the family). Her troubles worsen when Daphne, a friend she'd been drinking with, is severely injured in a drunken car wreck. Claire is convinced that Daphne's husband, Lockhart, holds her responsible, so she's surprised when he asks her to co-chair a charity gala and create a new piece of glass art for auction. The plot mushrooms as Claire and Lockhart begin an affair; Claire rethinks her priorities; a slew of gala-related complications arise; and Claire's ex-boyfriend turned rock star comes into play. Hilderbrand keeps a lot of balls in the air, and if she pays too much attention to event-planning minutiae, there are still enough conflicts to keep readers entertained. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now he was the fastest boy in Manhattan, New York. He was so fast, in fact, the ship that had brought him to America arrived a day early.</p><p>Now he stood on first base, waiting to run.</p><p>&#x201c;Put the poreen just about here, ya rawney Dutchman!&#x201d; the Striker called. English was difficult enough for Felix to understand, and almost unintelligible when spoken by the Irish. But the &#x201c;Dutchman&#x201d; at Feeder&#x2014;another German boy like Felix&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t need to understand Cormac&#x2019;s words to know where he wanted him to throw the ball. He lobbed it toward the plate and the Irish boy slapped the ball to the right side beyond first base.</p><p>Felix ran full out. His legs churned in the soft mud, but his shoes gave him traction, propelling him toward second base. He was a racehorse, a locomotive. The world was a blur when he ran, and he could feel his blood thumping through his veins like the steam pistons pounding out a rhythm on the fast ferry to Staten Island. Felix flew past the parcel that stood for second base and dug for third.</p><p>&#x201c;Soak him!&#x201d; one of the boys called. Felix glanced over his shoulder just in time to see an English boy hurl the baseball at him. He danced out of the way and the ball sailed past him, missing his vest by less than an inch. Felix laughed and charged on to third, turning on the cap there and heading for home.</p><p>&#x201c;Soak the bloody devil!&#x201d; one of the other Irish boys cried. The ball came at Felix again, but this time the throw was well wide. He pounced on the rock at home plate with both feet and celebrated the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Ace!&#x201d; Felix cried. &#x201c;Ace, ace, ace!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No it weren&#x2019;t,&#x201d; called one of the buckwheats, a boy just back from the Ohio territory. &#x201c;You missed second base!&#x201d;</p><p>Felix ran straight to second base to argue, and was met there by the boys on both teams.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re out, ya plonker!&#x201d; said one of the Irish boys.</p><p>&#x201c;The heck I was!&#x201d; said Felix. He stepped forward to challenge him, and the boy laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;You sure you want to get them fancy ones and twos there muddy, Dutchman?&#x201d;</p><p>He was on again about Felix&#x2019;s shoes, which were better than everyone else&#x2019;s. Felix&#x2019;s father, a cobbler, had made them for him&#x2014;sturdy brown leather lace-ups with good thick heels. They were the only thing he still had to remind him of his family back in Bremen.</p><p>The boys looked down at Felix&#x2019;s shoes. That&#x2019;s when they all saw Felix&#x2019;s footprints in the wet earth. He&#x2019;d missed second base by a foot.</p><p>&#x201c;Three out, all out,&#x201d; the buckwheat said.</p><p>Felix snatched the ball from the boy&#x2019;s hand and plunked him hard in the shoulder with it.</p><p>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d; Felix cried.</p><p>The lot became a battlefield as both teams went back and forth, tagging each other and dashing for home to see who would earn the right to bat next. Felix had just ducked out of the way of a ball aimed for his head when someone grabbed him by the ear and stood him up.</p><p>&#x201c;Felix Schneider!&#x201d; his uncle Albert yelled.</p><p>The game of tag ground to an abrupt halt and the boys shirked away as Felix&#x2019;s uncle laid into him.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew you would be here, you worthless boy! You should have been back an hour ago! Where is the parcel you were sent to deliver?&#x201d;</p><p>Felix glanced meekly at second base.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve buried it in the mud!?&#x201d; Felix&#x2019;s uncle cuffed him. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve ruined those pieces, it&#x2019;ll mean both our jobs! My family will be out on the streets, and you will never earn passage for yours. Is this why you stowed away aboard that ship? To come to America and play games?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;N-no sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Uncle Albert dragged Felix over to the parcel.</p><p>&#x201c;Pick it up. Pick it up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t step on it, see? I missed the bag&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>His uncle struck him again, and Felix said nothing more. With his speed he knew he still had plenty of time to deliver the fabric pieces, and time enough to go to the Neumans&#x2019;, pick up their finished suits, and get them to Lord &amp; Taylor by the close of business too. He also knew his uncle wouldn&#x2019;t want to hear it.</p><p>&#x201c;Now go. Go!&#x201d; Uncle Albert told him. &#x201c;If you were my son, I&#x2019;d whip you!&#x201d;</p><p><i>And if I were your son,</i> thought Felix as he dashed off with the parcel, <i>I&#x2019; d run away to California.</i></p><p>Felix ran to where the Neumans lived on East Eighth Street off Avenue B, in the heart of &#x201c;Kleindeutschland,&#x201d; Little Germany. Their tenement stood in the shadow of a fancier building facing the street on the same lot. The Neumans lived on the fourth floor, two brothers and their families squeezed into a one-family flat with three rooms and no windows. Felix hated visiting there. It made him think of those preachers who stood on street corners throughout Kleindeutschland yelling warnings of damnation and hell. As much as he disliked his uncle, Felix knew that but for Uncle Albert&#x2019;s job as a cutter, their own Kleindeutschland flat would look like this. Or worse.</p><p>One of the Neuman boys, not much older than Felix, met him at the door. Felix only knew him from deliveries and pickups&#x2014;he&#x2019;d never seen any of the Neuman boys playing on Little Germany&#x2019;s streets or empty lots.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Guten tag,&#x201d;</i> the boy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; said Felix. He held out the parcel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got your new pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy let Felix into the room. It was hot and dark, and Neumans young and old sweated as they sewed cut pieces of cloth into suits around the dim light of four flickering candles. Herr Neuman, the family &#x201c;foreman,&#x201d; came forward to take the package from Felix.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Danke sch�n,&#x201d;</i> Herr Neuman said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Felix said. <i>&#x201c;Bitte.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Herr Neuman set the parcel on a table and opened it, counting out the pieces. He nodded to let Felix know everything was in order.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have anything for me to take back?&#x201d; Felix asked. <i>&#x201c;Haben Sie noch etwas fertig?&#x201d;</i></p><p>Herr Neuman held up a finger and went into another room. Felix waved to one or two of the women who looked up at him with weak smiles. Felix knew this wasn&#x2019;t what they had expected when they&#x2019;d come to America. It wasn&#x2019;t what any of them had expected. Felix&#x2019;s own father had talked of New York as a promised land, where everyone had good jobs and plenty to eat. &#x201c;Manhattan is a city of three hundred thousand,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said, &#x201c;and half of those are men who will need a good pair of shoes.&#x201d; Herr Neuman, a skilled tailor, had probably said the same thing to his family about the men in Manhattan needing suits.</p></p><h2>Super Bug Encyclopedia: The Biggest, Fastest, Deadliest Creepy-Crawlers on the Planet (DK Super Nature Encyclopedias)</h2><p><p>A look at the 100 most amazing insects on the planet!</p><p>Using macro photography and brand-new CGI artworks, <i>Super Bug</i>&nbsp;<i>Encyclopedia</i> zooms right in to reveal the secrets of the most successful creatures on our planet.

Animals are grouped by broad categories such as anatomy, physical features, hunting, threats to humans, and life cycles. Each spread is devoted to a different species, with particular emphasis on a notable feature, such as the trap-jaw ant's lethal bite or the see-through wings of the glasswing butterfly. Most include a stunning image of the insect along with smaller, captioned photos or diagrams. Varied page layouts and a mixture of backgrounds provide fresh visual looks with each page turn. Articles include an introductory paragraph; an "At a Glance" list covering size, habitat, location, and diet; and a "Stats and Facts" feature, which provides more specific details, such as a graph of the mole cricket's burrowing depth. The large photographs, many of which fill most of a spread, are frequently spectacular: a vivid close-up of the green tiger beetle's head and an amazing view of a cicada nymph shedding its skin are among many first-rate examples, though a few photos lose impact because of the gutter. Cutaway views showing internal physiology and well-chosen spot images add further specific visual content.

Being a masochist, I asked our research department to tell me exactly how many people were watching. They came back with the vastly reassuring number of 5.019 million. (If you are in the mood for a nice dose of schadenfreude, you can readily find the whole clip on YouTube. Just search for &#x201c;panic attack on live TV,&#x201d; and it will pop right up. Which is awesome for me.)<br><br>In the wake of my nationally televised freak-out, I learned something even more embarrassing: the entire episode had been caused by some phenomenally stupid behavior in my personal life. After spending years covering war zones for ABC News as an ambitious and idealistic young reporter, I had developed an undiagnosed depression. For months I was having trouble getting out of bed in the morning, and felt as if I had a permanent, low-grade fever. Out of desperation, I began self-medicating with recreational drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy. My drug use was short-lived and intermittent. If you&#x2019;ve ever seen the movie The Wolf of Wall Street, in which the characters are pounding Quaaludes every five minutes&#x2014;it was nothing like that. However, my consumption was enough, according to the doctor I consulted after the panic attack, to artificially raise the level of adrenaline in my brain, exacerbating my baseline anxiety and priming me to have my very public meltdown.<br><br>Through a strange and circuitous series of events, the panic attack ultimately led me to embrace a practice I had always dismissed as ridiculous. For most of my life, to the extent that I&#x2019;d ever even considered meditation, I ranked it right alongside aura readings, Enya, and the unironic use of the word &#x201c;namaste.&#x201d; Further, I figured my racing, type-A mind was way too busy to ever be able to commune with the cosmos. And anyway, if I got too happy, it would probably render me completely ineffective at my hypercompetitive job.<br><br>Two things changed my mind.<br><br>The first was the science.<br><br>In recent years, there has been an explosion of research into meditation, which has been shown to<br><br>�Reduce blood pressure<br><br>�Boost recovery after the release of the stress hormone cortisol<br><br>�Improve immune system functioning and response<br><br>�Slow age-related atrophy of the brain<br><br>�Mitigate the symptoms of depression and anxiety<br><br>Studies also show meditation can reduce violence in prisons, boost productivity in the workplace, and improve both behavior and grades for school children.<br><br>Things really get interesting when you look at the neuroscience. In recent years, neuroscientists have been peering into the heads of meditators, and they&#x2019;ve found that the practice can rewire key parts of the brain involved with self-awareness, compassion, and resiliency. One study from the Harvard Gazette found that just eight weeks of meditation resulted in measurable decreases in gray matter density in the area of the brain associated with stress.<br><br>The science is still in its early stages and the findings are preliminary. I worry that it has provoked a certain amount of irrational exuberance in the media. (&#x201c;Meditation can cure halitosis and enable you to dunk on a regulation hoop!&#x201d;) However, when you aggregate the most rigorous studies, they strongly suggest that daily meditation can deliver a long list of health benefits.<br><br>The research has catalyzed a fascinating public health revolution, with the ancient practice of meditation catching on among corporate executives, athletes, U.S. marines, and entertainers, including the rapper 50 Cent. That man got shot nine times; I believe he deserves some peace of mind.<br><br>The second thing I learned that changed my mind about meditation is that it does not necessarily entail a lot of the weird stuff I feared it might.<br><br>Contrary to popular belief, meditation does not involve folding yourself into a pretzel, joining a group, or wearing special outfits. The word &#x201c;meditation&#x201d; is a little bit like the word &#x201c;sports&#x201d;; there are hundreds of varieties. The type of meditation we&#x2019;ll be teaching here is called &#x201c;mindfulness meditation,&#x201d; which is derived from Buddhism but does not require adopting a belief system or declaring oneself to be a Buddhist. (In defense of Buddhism, by the way, it is often practiced not as a faith but as a set of tools to help people lead more fulfilled lives in a universe characterized by impermanence and entropy. One of my favorite quotes on the matter is &#x201c;Buddhism is not something to believe in, but rather something to do.&#x201d;)<br><br>In any event, what we&#x2019;re teaching here is simple, secular exercise for your brain. To give you a sense of exactly how simple it is, here are the three-step instructions for beginning meditation. You don&#x2019;t actually have to do this right now; I&#x2019;ll bring in a ringer soon.<br><br>1. Sit comfortably. It&#x2019;s best to have your spine reasonably straight, which may help prevent an involuntary nap. If you want to sit on the floor in the lotus position, go for it. If not, just sit in a chair, as I do. You can close your eyes or, if you prefer, you can leave them open and adjust your gaze to a neutral point on the ground.<br><br>2. Bring your full attention to the feeling of your breath coming in and out. Pick a spot where it&#x2019;s most prominent: your chest, your belly, or your nostrils. You&#x2019;re not thinking about your breath, you&#x2019;re just feeling the raw data of the physical sensations. To help maintain focus, you can make a quiet mental note on the in-breath and out-breath, like in and out.<br><br>3. The third step is the key. As soon as you try to do this, your mind is almost certainly going to mutiny. You&#x2019;ll start having all sorts of random thoughts, such as: What&#x2019;s for lunch? Do I need a haircut? What was Casper the Friendly Ghost before he died? Who was the Susan after whom they named the lazy Susan, and how did she feel about it? No big deal. This is totally normal. The whole game is simply to notice when you are distracted, and begin again. And again. And again.<br><br>Every time you catch yourself wandering and escort your attention back to the breath, it is like a biceps curl for the brain. It is also a radical act: you&#x2019;re breaking a lifetime&#x2019;s habit of walking around in a fog of rumination and projection, and you are actually focusing on what&#x2019;s happening right now.<br><br>I have heard from countless people who assume that they could never meditate because they can&#x2019;t stop thinking. I cannot say this frequently enough: the goal is not to clear your mind but to focus your mind&#x2014;for a few nanoseconds at a time&#x2014;and whenever you become distracted, just start again. Getting lost and starting over is not failing at meditation, it is succeeding.<br><br>I think this pernicious clear-the-mind misconception stems in part from the fact that meditation has been the victim of the worst marketing campaign for anything ever. The traditional art depicting meditation, while often beautiful, can be badly misleading. It usually shows practitioners with beatific looks on their faces. Examples abound in Buddhist temples, airport spas, and in this picture of a man in a loincloth I found on the Internet.<br><br>Based on my own practice, this image better captures the experience of meditation:<br><br>Meditation can be difficult, especially at the beginning. It&#x2019;s like going to the gym. If you work out and you&#x2019;re not panting or sweating, you&#x2019;re probably cheating. Likewise, if you start meditating and find yourself in a thought-free field of bliss, either you have rocketed to enlightenment or you have died.<br><br>The practice does get easier the longer you keep at it, but even after doing it for years, I get lost all the time. Here&#x2019;s a random sample of my mental chatter during a typical meditation session:<br><br>In<br><br>Out<br><br>Man, I am feeling antsy. What&#x2019;s the Yiddish term my grandmother used to use for that? Shpilkes. Right.<br><br>Words that always make me giggle: &#x201c;ointment,&#x201d; &#x201c;pianist.&#x201d;<br><br>Wait, what? Come on, man. Back to the breath.<br><br>In<br><br>Out<br><br>Likes: baked goods.<br><br>Dislikes: fedoras, dream sequences, that part in techno songs where the French accordion kicks in.<br><br>Dude. Come. On.<br><br>In<br><br>Out<br><br>In<br><br>Alternative jobs: papal nuncio, interpretive dancer, working double time on the seduction line . . . <br><br>You get the idea.<br><br>So why put yourself through this?<br><br>Meditation forces you into a direct collision with a fundamental fact of life that is not often pointed out to us: we all have a voice in our heads.<br><br>(The reason the above looks amateurish and slightly creepy is that I drew it, but bear with me.)<br><br>When I talk about the voice in your head, I&#x2019;m not referring to schizophrenia or anything like that; I&#x2019;m talking about your internal narrator. It&#x2019;s sometimes called your &#x201c;ego.&#x201d; The Buddha had a cool name for it: &#x201c;the monkey mind.&#x201d;<br><br>Here are some key attributes of the voice in my head. I suspect they will sound familiar.<br><br>�It&#x2019;s often fixated on the past and future, at the expense of whatever is happening right now. The voice loves to plan, plot, and scheme. It&#x2019;s always making lists or rehearsing arguments or drafting tweets. One moment it has you fantasizing about some halcyon past or Elysian future. Another moment you&#x2019;re ruing old mistakes or catastrophizing about some not-yet-arrived events. As Mark Twain is reputed to have said, &#x201c;Some of the worst things in my life never even happened.&#x201d;<br><br>�The voice is insatiable. The default mental condition for too many human beings is dissatisfaction. Under the sway of the ego, nothing is good enough. We&#x2019;re always on the hunt for the next dopamine hit. We hurl ourselves headlong from one cookie, one promotion, one party to the next, and yet a great many of us are never fully sated. How many meals, movies, and vacations have you enjoyed? And are you done yet? Of course not.<br><br>�The voice is unrelievedly self-involved. We are all the stars of our own movies, whether we cast ourselves as hero, victim, black hat, or all three. True, we can get temporarily sucked into other people&#x2019;s stories, but often as a means of comparing ourselves to them. Everything ultimately gets subordinated to the one plotline that matters: the Story of Me.<br><br>In short, the voice in my head&#x2014;and perhaps also yours&#x2014;can be an asshole.<br><br>To be fair, our internal narrator is not all bad. It is capable of brilliance, humor, and compassion. It is also extremely useful when designing irrigation systems and composing piano sonatas. Nevertheless, when I bother to listen, most of what I hear inside is rather obnoxious. I am not alone in this. I have a friend, a fellow meditator, who jokes that when he considers the voice in his head, he feels like he&#x2019;s been kidnapped by the most boring person alive, who says the same baloney over and over, most of it negative, nearly all of it self-referential.<br><br>When you are unaware of this ceaseless inner talkfest, it can control and deceive you. The ego&#x2019;s terrible suggestions often come to the party dressed up as common sense:<br><br>You should eat that entire sleeve of Oreos; you&#x2019;ve had a hard day.<br><br>Go ahead, you have every right to make the wisecrack that will ruin the next forty-eight hours of your marriage.<br><br>You don&#x2019;t need to meditate. You&#x2019;ll never be able to do it anyway.<br><br>One of the things that most powerfully drew me to meditation was the realization&#x2014;many years after the fact, sadly&#x2014;that the voice in my head was responsible for the most mortifying moment of my life: my on-air panic attack. It was because of my ego that I went off to war zones without considering the psychological consequences, was insufficiently self-aware to recognize my subsequent depression, and then blindly self-medicated.<br><br>I began my meditation practice slowly, with just five to ten minutes a day, which is what I recommend everyone aim for at the start. (And, frankly, if you only find time for one minute a day, you can count that as a win. Much more on this soon.) For me, the first sign that meditation was not a waste of time came within weeks, when I started to overhear my wife, Bianca, at cocktail parties telling friends that I had become less of a jerk.<br><br>Internally, I pretty quickly began to notice three primary benefits, in ascending order of importance:<br><br>1. Calm<br><br>The act of stepping out of my daily busyness for a few minutes and simply breathing often injected a dose of sanity into my hectic day. It served to interrupt, if only briefly, the current of mindlessness that often carried me along. The issue of calmness is a bit tricky, though. Many people are drawn to meditation because they want to relax, but they end up disappointed because the ever-declaiming ego keeps butting in or because itches and knee pain arise. While meditation can often be calming, it&#x2019;s best not to go into it expecting to feel a certain way. And, importantly, even if an individual meditation session isn&#x2019;t mellow, I&#x2019;ve found that the net effect of having a daily practice is that, overall, my emotional weather is significantly balmier.<br><br>2. Focus<br><br>We live in an era defined by what&#x2019;s been called &#x201c;omni-connectivity.&#x201d; Many of us are beset by emails, texts, status updates, and push notifications. It can leave us feeling frayed and frazzled. In my job, I actually have other people&#x2019;s voices piped directly into my head, and I have to get the facts straight, on short notice, in front of large audiences. I found that the daily exercise of trying to focus on one thing at a time&#x2014;my breath&#x2014;and then getting lost and starting again (and again, and again) helped me stay on task during the course of my day. Studies show the more you meditate, the better you are at activating the regions of the brain associated with attention and deactivating the regions associated with mind-wandering.<br><br>3. Mindfulness<br><br>This rather anodyne-sounding word has become quite buzzy of late. There are now countless books and articles on mindful eating, mindful parenting, mindful sex, mindful dishwashing, mindful yarn-bombing, mindful conjugation of verbs in Esperanto, and on and on. The media fuss has, at times, turned this down-to-earth, universally accessible concept into an impossibly precious thing, and provoked a not-entirely-unjustified backlash. And yet, if you can get past the breathless headlines and press releases, mindfulness is an enormously useful skill.<br><br>It is a rich, ancient term with lots of meanings, but here&#x2019;s my personal definition:<br><br>Mindfulness is the ability to see what&#x2019;s happening in your head at any given moment, so that you don&#x2019;t get carried away by it.<br><br>As an example, imagine you&#x2019;re driving down the road and someone cuts you off. How does that moment go for you, usually? If you&#x2019;re like me, you may feel a big blast of anger, which is normal. But then you might automatically act on that anger, honking, and cursing, and so on. There&#x2019;s no buffer between the stimulus and your reflexive reaction.</p><h2>National Geographic Readers: Alien Ocean Animals (L3)</h2><p><b>Are these strange animals the stuff of nightmares or aliens from outer space?

It can make us uncomfortable and smelly. But at times, the best things in life include some parts that aren&#x2019;t so great. Then we have to decide how to respond.<br> <br>Every summer, I go to one of my very favorite places, Camp Ch-Yo-Ca. I love summers at camp! But when I am there, I know I&#x2019;m going to sweat!<br> <br>You might have read about camp in my book Live Original, or seen a few pics on Instagram. I go every summer. One of the things we do at camp is called an Attitude Check, which brings me back to sweating. It&#x2019;s hot at camp, and there are bugs and, maybe, a snake or two. In other words, it&#x2019;s not perfect&#x2014;there are definitely things that make you feel uncomfortable or uneasy. But nothing in life is perfect. That&#x2019;s why one of my grandma&#x2019;s favorite quotes is &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t change the situation, change your attitude.&#x201d;<br> <br>In some ways, camp is like real life. At camp and in real life there are unpleasant parts that you have to either deal with or ignore, but it&#x2019;s worth the effort because, at the same time, there can also be amazing benefits. Some of those benefits for me at camp are learning more about God and His plan for my life and making lifelong friends.<br> <br>So here&#x2019;s how an Attitude Check works: When the counselors or directors notice the campers dragging around and looking less than excited about being there, one of them will yell, &#x201c;Attitude Check!&#x201d; and the campers respond with, &#x201c;I feel great! Oh, I feel so great!&#x201d; Then it ends with a loud &#x201c;Uh!&#x201d; Seriously, immediately you feel better.<br> <br>In life, I know you won&#x2019;t feel great every day&#x2014;there&#x2019;s going to be some sweating&#x2014;but every day you can find something to feel great about. So the next time you feel down or don&#x2019;t feel like smiling, you might need to challenge yourself to an Attitude Check. Of course, your mom might get a little worried when she hears you yelling out loud about how great you feel, but trust me, when she hears your positive message, she will probably feel great too!<br> What Does the Bible Say About It? <p></p> <br>Romans 15:5&#x2013;6 (NIV)<br> <br>May the God who gives endurance and encouragement give you the same attitude of mind toward each other that Christ Jesus had, so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br> Dig a Little Deeper <p></p> <br>The book of Romans was written with two reasons in mind. First, Paul wanted to be sure the Christians in Rome knew that, because of God&#x2019;s righteousness (or justice), salvation (or deliverance from sin and its consequences) is possible. The best way I can describe God&#x2019;s righteousness is that God is right all the time&#x2014;and He always does what is right. He is honest and just and worthy and blameless. We cannot be righteous on our own&#x2014;we can only get righteousness from God.<br> <br>Read Romans 1:16&#x2013;17 (NIV) and fill in the blanks.<br> <br>For I am not .................................. of the .................................. , because it is the power of God that brings .................................. to everyone who believes: first to the .................................. , then to the ................................... For in the gospel the ......................... of God is revealed&#x2014;a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: &#x201c;The righteous will live by ...................................... .&#x201d;<br> <br>And second, Paul wanted to give some instruction on how to live a Christian life.<br> <br>In Romans 15:5&#x2013;6, we are told to have the same attitude of mind with each other as who?<br> <br>If we are to have a good attitude anywhere near that of Jesus, we have to know what His attitude is, and the only way we can do that is by learning more about Him. Keep studying every day to find out who Jesus Christ is and how He lived. Then you will know how to be and to act in a way that honors Him.<br> Live It! <p></p> <br>Part of living for Jesus is having and presenting the right attitude. Our attitude affects our approach to life. We can choose to approach each day complaining and looking for the bad, or we can approach each day looking for the good. Write our verse for the week, Romans 15:5&#x2013;6, on a note card and put it up on your bathroom mirror. Say it every morning at least three times. It&#x2019;s a little long, but you can do it.

Three bodies. Three days. <br><br>After a string of brutal murders in Las Vegas, Cassie Hobbes and the Naturals are called in to investigate.

All of the victims were killed in public, yet the killer does not show up on any security feed. And each victim has a string of numbers tattooed on their wrist. Hidden in the numbers is a code-and the closer the Naturals come to unraveling the mystery, the more perilous the case becomes. <br>Meanwhile, Cassie is dealing with an equally dangerous and much more painful mystery.

Congratulations!&nbsp;Effective, encouraging, and up-to-date, <i>When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads</i> is essential for you and your babies.&nbsp;Like all mothers-to-be, you're experiencing the full spectrum of human emotions: joy, fear, confusion, and excitement--maybe all at once. As a woman pregnant with more than one baby, you're feeling all these things . . . only more so!&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>When You're Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads </i>outlines a practical, nutrition-based program to keep you and your babies healthy, and provides a comprehensive tour of what you can expect during your unique pregnancy and childbirth experience. Women who follow this program have significantly fewer complications during pregnancy--and their babies are born healthier, weighing 20 to 35 percent more than the average twin, triplet, or quad. Included is crucial information on:&nbsp;<br>* Finding a qualified maternal/fetal medicine specialist&nbsp;<br>* Dietary recommendations, menus, and 75 recipes for maximizing birthweight <br>* Safe guidelines on exercise, physical activity, and work <br>* Reducing your risk for pregnancy complications&nbsp;<br>* Recognizing the signs of preterm labor and what to do about them&nbsp;<br>* How twin type (fraternal vs. identical) affects prenatal care<br>* What to expect during and after delivery <br>* Feeding and caring for your newborns . . . and yourself</p><p>The double whammy of successful infertility treatments and an increase in the number of women having children later in life has resulted in a staggering--but perhaps not surprising--phenomenon: a tremendous increase in twin, triple, and quadruple births. <i>When You�re Expecting Twins, Triplets, or Quads</i> is an outstanding, much-needed addition to the pregnancy genre for women who face the alternating joy, terror, and ambivalence associated with carrying, delivering, and coping with young multiples.<p> Subjects like nutrition, mom's changing body and emotions, fetal development, potential complications, and labor and delivery take on new meaning when you add another baby or two to the standard equation. With the goal of minimizing risk factors associated with multiple births, Dr. Barbara Luke and her team of writers cover each subject with a buoyant determination to tell it all and tell it well--avoiding the typical "how to name and dress your twins" issues. Accompanying the detailed medical perspective of Dr. Luke are personal experiences gathered from the journals of a few articulate moms, making each subject as real as it is educational. Simple illustrations, valuable charts (including one to plot and monitor fetal growth in grams or pounds), specific menu examples (like how <i>can</i> you consume 4,500 calories if you're expecting quads???), and lots of reassurance make this book a winner. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p><p><strong>You&#x2019;re expecting more than one baby?

He Found Me<p></p> <br>In class we say That&#x2019;s too on the nose when someone has written a story or a scene where exactly what you think should happen does happen. Or when the events are too perfect or precise. But in real life we have a hard time recognizing serendipitous moments because we&#x2019;re not making the story up as we go along. It&#x2019;s not a lie&#x2014;it&#x2019;s really happening to us, and we have no idea how it will end. Some of us will look back on our lives and recall events that were a bit too perfect, but until you know the whole story, it&#x2019;s impossible to see the universe at work, or even admit that there is something bigger than us, making sure everything that should happen does happen. If you can surrender to the idea that there might be a plan, instead of reducing every magical moment to a coincidence, then love will find you. He found me.<br> <br>&#x201c;WOW, THE SEAGULLS are going crazy. I think there&#x2019;s a tsunami headed this way,&#x201d; I said, staring out the window of my second-story apartment as I watched the marine layer thicken over La Jolla Cove. The fog was moving fast toward my building as the storm clouds swirled in the distance.<br> <br>Trevor laughed. &#x201c;Such a San Diegan, overreacting to the weather.&#x201d; He was sitting on the floor with his back against the overpriced leather couch that my aunts Cyndi and Sharon had bought for me when I first moved in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think we need sandbags?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re being crazy,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Crazy or cautious?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;More like neurotic. It&#x2019;s drizzling. California is still technically in a drought.&#x201d;<br> <br>I noticed that Trevor had put down the short story I had written so he could continue playing Angry Birds on his phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trevor . . .&#x201d; I warned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emiline . . .&#x201d; he teased back without looking up.<br> <br>I plopped onto his lap and threw my arms around his neck. &#x201c;I really want you to read it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did. I read it fast.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s it about, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s about a girl who discovers an ancient formula for cold fusion.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you got the gist. But did you actually like it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Emi . . .&#x201d; He paused. His eyes darted around the room. When he focused on me again, I saw pity in his face. &#x201c;I liked it a lot,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But . . . ?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you should write what you know. You&#x2019;re a good writer, but this&#x201d;&#x2014;he held up the paper&#x2014;&#x201c;seems a little silly.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Silly? Why?&#x201d; I could feel anger boiling over inside of me. Trevor was honest&#x2014;it was one of the reasons I liked him&#x2014;but sometimes he was blunt to the point of belittling.<br> <br>&#x201c;For one, it&#x2019;s unrealistic.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s science fiction,&#x201d; I shot back.<br> <br>&#x201c;It needs more character development.&#x201d; He shrugged as if his statement were obvious.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trevor, please don&#x2019;t start spewing that Writing 101 crap at me. I get enough of that in the program. I want to practice what I preach. I&#x2019;m constantly telling the undergrads to forget the rules and write intuitively. Now I&#x2019;m asking you for realistic feedback, from a reader&#x2019;s point of view, not an instructor&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to. I thought that&#x2019;s what I was doing. You know how hard it is for me to critique your work. You can&#x2019;t handle it. I didn&#x2019;t connect with the characters, so I wasn&#x2019;t interested in reading the rest of the story. So there. I&#x2019;m just being honest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a nice way to be honest,&#x201d; I muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;I still finished the story, and now I&#x2019;m trying to help you, but you&#x2019;re not being receptive to it. Just tell me what you want me to say.&#x201d;<br> <br>I crossed my arms over my chest. &#x201c;Are you serious right now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He got up abruptly and I toppled over onto the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not a reader. I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked you to read it. Are we actually fighting over this?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re always fighting over this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And I resent you for saying that I&#x2019;m not a reader, as if I&#x2019;m some kind of illiterate Neanderthal.&#x201d;<br> <br>I had been dating Trevor since our senior year at Berkeley, so I knew exactly where this insecurity was coming from. Seven years&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a long time in anyone&#x2019;s book. When we met, he was a superstar quarterback destined for the NFL, and I was a bookworm trying to be a wordsmith. He was Tom Brady handsome, and for so long I wondered why he was into me at all. Yet for some reason, in the beginning, it just felt right. We got along beautifully, and our relationship went on like a fairy tale&#x2014;until he injured his throwing arm in the last game of the season. His professional football career was over before it even began.<br> <br>He graduated unglamorously and then took an assistant offensive coaching job at San Diego State so he could be closer to me while I worked on my MFA at UC San Diego. It was a major show of dedication, but I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel like a little light had gone off inside of him. He was there in San Diego with me, but sometimes I felt like he wanted to be somewhere else.<br> <br>The dynamics of any long-term relationship tend to shift in subtle ways, but for us, the change was more abrupt: the moment he got injured, I wasn&#x2019;t the nerdy bookworm infatuated with the star quarterback anymore. And while that never bothered me, it definitely bothered him. Even after he followed me to San Diego, we continued to live separately, and neither one of us pressed the issue, even after I finished my MFA. I told myself I was waiting for him to make the move, to own the decision, but honestly I didn&#x2019;t know if I wanted to move in with him either.<br> <br>So I kept living with my roommate, Cara, a fellow graduate from the UCSD writing program. She was saving money and teaching a couple of writing courses while she worked on her first novel, and I was trying to do the same. Her longtime boyfriend, Henry, was a surgical resident in New York, and she planned to move at the end of the school year to be with him. I knew I had to figure something out by then, but arguments like this made me think Trevor and I still weren&#x2019;t ready to take the next step.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going for a run,&#x201d; I said to Trevor as I hurried toward my bedroom to get dressed.<br> <br>&#x201c;What? One minute you&#x2019;re worried about a tsunami and the next you want to go for a run? What the hell?&#x201d; He followed behind me. &#x201c;Emi, you&#x2019;re going to have to deal with your shit at some point.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My shit? What about your shit?&#x201d; I said flatly as I sat on the floor, tying my shoes. I wasn&#x2019;t even looking at him. I got up and tried to move past him to leave the room. I might have been carrying around some baggage, but so was Trevor.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have to stop running every time I want to have a bigger conversation with you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Later,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, now,&#x201d; he said firmly.<br> <br>I shimmied between his body and my bedroom door and headed toward the kitchen. I busied myself filling up a water bottle.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been together since we were twenty, Emi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jesus, I just asked you to read a fucking story.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not about the story.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it about, then?&#x201d; I asked sharply.<br> <br>He looked frustrated and defeated, which was rare for him. I felt a twinge of guilt and softened.<br> <br>&#x201c;Trevor, I don&#x2019;t know if you can tell, but I&#x2019;m having a hard time with my writing right now. I don&#x2019;t want to be an adjunct creative writing professor forever. Do you get that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re already a writer, Emi.&#x201d; He seemed sincere, but it wasn&#x2019;t exactly what I wanted to hear.<br> <br>&#x201c;All of the other adjuncts have been published in some right, except for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cara&#x2019;s been published?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Twice,&#x201d; I said under my breath.<br> <br>He hesitated before continuing. &#x201c;You want to know what I think? It&#x2019;s not a lack of talent, Emi. I just don&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re writing what you know. Why don&#x2019;t you try writing about yourself? Explore everything you went through when you were a kid?&#x201d;<br> <br>I felt myself getting mad again. He knew my childhood was off-limits. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to talk about it, and besides, you&#x2019;re totally missing the point.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pulling my hoodie up over my hair, I pushed the door open and jogged down the stairs toward the walkway as the rain pelted my face. I heard Trevor slam the door and jog down the steps behind me. I stopped on the sidewalk, turned, and looked up at him. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going home,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We still need to talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded. &#x201c;Later.&#x201d; He turned on his heel and walked away. I stood for a moment before turning in the opposite direction . . . and then I was running.<br> <br>I was convinced that the years of therapy my aunt Cyndi and her partner, Sharon, had paid for guaranteed my past would always be just that. Still, I knew in the back of my mind that I hadn&#x2019;t quite dealt with what happened on that long dirt road in Ohio, all those years before I came to live with Cyndi and Sharon. I was guarded and withdrawn, hiding in my relationship with Trevor, in my job as an adjunct professor, in my writing. I knew all of this, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get out of the rut.<br> <br>After a few miles, I found myself jogging through the parking lot at UCSD, getting thoroughly soaked by massive raindrops.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emi!&#x201d; I heard Cara call from behind me. &#x201c;Wait up!&#x201d;<br> <br>I turned and tightened the strings on my hoodie. &#x201c;Hurry, I&#x2019;m getting drenched!&#x201d;<br> <br>Cara&#x2019;s straight blonde hair clung to her cheeks, making her look even thinner than she was, as she jogged toward me. She was the opposite of me&#x2014;tall, lanky, with light hair and light eyes. I had frizzy, dark hair that flew everywhere, all the time.<br> <br>We took cover beneath the overhang of the building that housed the creative writing department. &#x201c;Jeez, Emi, your hair.&#x201d; Cara tried unsuccessfully to pat it down as we walked into the building and shook the water off our clothes. Before I could retort, we caught sight of Professor James as he was locking up his office.<br> <br>&#x201c;Professor!&#x201d; Cara called.<br> <br>He fit every possible stereotype of a college professor. He was plump, had a thick beard, and always dressed in herringbone or argyle. It was easy to imagine a pipe dangling from the side of his mouth as he talked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have those notes on my story for me?&#x201d; Cara asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;As a matter of fact, I do.&#x201d; He shuffled through his distressed leather briefcase and handed Cara a stack of papers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve written them in the margins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cara craved constructive criticism, but I never found the professor&#x2019;s notes all that helpful, even when I was in the program. After I graduated, I stopped letting him read my work.<br> <br>As she scanned his marginalia, Professor James looked me over. &#x201c;What are you working on, Emiline?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just doing scene exercises.&#x201d; I looked away, avoiding his stare.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean with your students. I meant with your personal projects.&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought idly that the only personal project I wanted to work on was plucking my eyebrows and shaving my legs. &#x201c;Oh, just some short stories.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you ever want some feedback, feel free to drop your work off in my office.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shifted uncomfortably. &#x201c;Thanks, I&#x2019;ll consider it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I glanced at Cara&#x2019;s story and noticed, in bold red writing, at the top of the page, the note BRILLIANT!!<br> <br>Professor James nodded good-bye and walked away. I turned to Cara. &#x201c;Two exclamation points? He&#x2019;s never said anything that nice about my work.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cara frowned. &#x201c;You know what I think about that, Emi.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh man, here we go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you don&#x2019;t like to hear it, but it&#x2019;s true. Maybe you&#x2019;re writing about the wrong stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>First Trevor, now Cara? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really good at baking&#x2014;does that mean I should be a baker?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know that&#x2019;s not what I mean,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; I looked down at my thrashed Nikes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just tired of missing the mark on these short stories. Trevor basically panned my last one.&#x201d; I looked up and nodded toward the end of the hall. &#x201c;Come on, let&#x2019;s walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>We headed toward the staff room to check our mailboxes in silence.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe you could work on a memoir? Even if you don&#x2019;t finish it, you might figure out what you want to explore in your short fiction. Something that&#x2019;s more personal to you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; I said, hoping that my tone conveyed how much I wanted her to drop it. She seemed to have gotten the hint and abruptly changed the subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;So, have you heard of this new writer that everyone&#x2019;s talking about? J. Colby?&#x201d;<br> <br>I shuffled through papers from my staff mailbox, tossing the junk mail in the trash. &#x201c;No, who&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Columbia grad. He&#x2019;s around our age. I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s already published. Everyone&#x2019;s raving about his novel.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good for him,&#x201d; I said bitterly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to read it, see what it&#x2019;s all about,&#x201d; she said as she jammed a sheaf of mail into her tote bag. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s called All the Roads Between. Don&#x2019;t you love that title?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, I guess. Kind of reminds me of The Bridges of Madison County or something.&#x201d; I turned to her. &#x201c;Okay, well, I&#x2019;m done here. I&#x2019;m gonna head home. You coming with?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you back there&#x2014;just have to run a few errands. But, hey, you know what we should do since it&#x2019;s so rainy out? We should stay in, get takeout, watch trash TV, and drink until we pass out. That&#x2019;ll cheer you up, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess. Yeah . . . that sounds good. Great, actually. Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d; Never mind that I&#x2019;d told Trevor I&#x2019;d watch football with him and talk. What I needed was a night in with my best friend. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll pick up the wine, you get the Chinese?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Deal. See you at home.&#x201d;<br> <br>THE SUN WAS going down behind the storm clouds as I sat on the window ledge and watched the waves crash against the rocks of the cove. I thought about the story I could write. I knew I had more than pages&#x2019; worth of material. I had books&#x2019; worth.

Animals are a huge part of every person&#x2019;s life. From the foods we eat to the clothes we wear, from the simple joy of owning a pet to the complexity of fighting on the battlefield, animals are our companions, coworkers, assistants, and fellow travelers on this planet we all call home.<br> <br>Why did you pick up this book, open it, and start reading? If your answer is, &#x201c;Because I love animals,&#x201d; awesome! That&#x2019;s step one.

Great start. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are you obsessed? Are you captivated by every dog or cat you see? Intrigued by herds of cows or horses? Fascinated by fish or whales? Does seeing an animal in need stir you to action? Do you get goosebumps just thinking about ways to protect animals in the wild? Does finding a cure for animal diseases drive you to take harder and harder science classes? Does the idea of extinction make your heart sink to your knees?<br> <br><br> <br>If you can answer YES! to any of those questions, or you feel that you are heading in the direction of a yes answer, then pursuing a career working with animals may be right for you.<br><br>World Leaders Have Pets Too<br> <br>Barack Obama, former president of the United States, adopted a Portuguese water dog named Bo.

The dog was a gift from the General of the Russian Army.<br><br> SPOTLIGHT <br> <br>Claude Bourgelat (1712&#x2013;1779), Founder of the World&#x2019;s First Veterinary Schools<br> <br>Claude Bourgelat was born on March 12, 1712, in Lyon, France, during the reign of Louis XIV. His father was a nobleman, and as his son, Bourgelat received an excellent education and was expected to pursue a career in law. After some time as a lawyer, he lost his focus and turned his attention to horses. Before long Bourgelat was considered the best in the nation at training and riding them. He was named the grand equerry of France and became director of the Lyon Academy of Horsemanship when he was only twenty-eight years old. The Lyon Academy was a school where young men studied horseback riding, music, math, manners, and swordsmanship.<br> <br>Bourgelat soon realized that his knowledge of horse anatomy and health issues was sorely lacking, so he set out to learn as much as he could from two Lyon surgeons. Ten years later, in 1750, his book, �l�mens d&#x2019;hippiatrique ou nouveaux principes sur la connoissance et sur la m�decine des chevaux (Elements of the Principles of Veterinary Art, or, New Knowledge about Medicine and Horses), was published.<br> <br><br> <br>The book detailed all his research into horses&#x2014;research based on his own observations and experiments. The book earned him a place in the Academy of Sciences, a society that was leading the way in scientific study in Europe. In the preface, Bourgelat wrote, &#x201c;Those who intend to [acquire skills in veterinary art] will not be able to acquire a sufficient degree of education&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [since] we do not have schools for teaching.&#x201d;1 It was clear that the idea of starting a veterinary school was already on his mind.<br> <br>Over the next decade, it became clear to Bourgelat that educated veterinarians were needed. Thousands of cattle in herds across the country were being destroyed by a disease known as the cattle plague. It was also a time when the health of the nation&#x2019;s horses was critical to maintaining a powerful army and the nation&#x2019;s security. He convinced the government of King Louis XV that the nation needed a school of veterinary medicine, and he received the money to start one.<br> <br>In 1761, the world&#x2019;s first veterinary college, the Royal Veterinary School of Lyon, was established. By the end of 1762, the first thirty-eight veterinary students were enrolled and beginning their studies. In 1765, Bourgelat founded the Alfort Veterinary School outside of Paris. Both colleges accepted students from throughout Europe. After graduation, those students returned to their home countries, spreading an understanding of how to use the scientific method (experience, observation, reasoning, analysis, and deduction) to study and treat diseases in animals.<br> <br>As a veterinary surgeon, Bourgelat was one of the first scientists to acknowledge that the scientific study of animal biology and pathology could lead to a better understanding of human biology and pathology. This revolutionary thought is considered the point when modern medicine was born. Bourgelat is also credited with being the creator of the modern veterinary profession. He died in Paris on January 3, 1779. He was sixty-six years old.<br> <br> Five Traits You Need to Work with Animals<p></p> Attentiveness<p></p> <br>Animals can&#x2019;t talk. That may seem like an obvious statement, but it&#x2019;s important for you to understand. They don&#x2019;t know what you are saying to them unless you teach them. By learning to pay close attention, you will notice when an animal is happy, scared, or feeling stressed and likely to lash out. Careful attention to each animal&#x2019;s unique behaviors is critical to knowing how it will react in a given situation. Being attentive also helps you learn to speak cat, dog, or even dolphin, and to be in tune with what they are trying to communicate to you.<br> <br><br> Courage<p></p> <br>Working with animals can be very dangerous. When caring for lions in the wild, elephants in captivity, or cows on a farm, you must remember that they bite, butt, kick, and scratch. It&#x2019;s up to you to be prepared for any event and face their actions with calm, controlled courage. It also takes courage to euthanize an animal. Whether it&#x2019;s a wild animal threatening people, a sick animal in a zoo, or a wounded cat in a pet clinic, you will make life-and-death decisions many times during your career. That takes courage too.<br> Empathy<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s hard for an animal to understand what a human is trying to do for it. Getting a shot hurts. Having your nails clipped is scary. Being captured and put in a cage is very traumatic! Animals don&#x2019;t understand that a shot protects against diseases, clipped nails protect against joint damage, or being captured may protect their species from going extinct. Having the ability to empathize with animals will help you make appropriate decisions for them, and your job will be easier in the long run.<br><br>Animal Tales Told in Movies<br> <br>When an intense bond is created between humans and animals it is always based on love, respect, and, most of all, trust. Here is a list of movies that depict that unique connection and the lengths people will go to to help protect the animals they love.<br> <br>The Amazing Panda Adventure (1995)<br> <br>Born Free (1966)<br> <br>Dolphin Tale (2011)<br> <br>Eight Below (2006)<br> <br>Free Willy (1993)<br> <br>The Horse Whisperer (1998)<br> <br>Hotel for Dogs (2009)<br> <br>The Journey Home (2014)<br> <br>Max (2015)<br> <br>Never Cry Wolf (1983)<br> <br>Secretariat (2010)<br> <br>Two Brothers (2004)<br> <br><br> <br> Patience<p></p> <br>Animals don&#x2019;t understand time. In their world, it takes as long as it takes. If you want to train a horse to compete in a rodeo, a dog to sniff out drugs, or a cat to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wait, no one teaches cats to do anything&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or a dolphin to perform at the aquarium, you must have patience. They learn at their own pace, and forcing them only leads to frustration for both animal and human.<br> <br><br><br>The American Bison<br> <br>On May 9, 2016, President Barack Obama signed the National Bison Legacy Act, which declared the American bison the United States&#x2019; national mammal. The bison, saved from near extinction in the early twentieth century, joins the American bald eagle as the nation&#x2019;s second national animal. Besides being a national symbol, the bison is the official mammal for three states. Its image also appears on two state flags and on the seal of the Department of the Interior.<br> <br> Realism<p></p> <br>When working with animals, you must learn and adapt to what an animal can and cannot do. Be realistic about the time it takes to train them. Be realistic about the need for culling a herd or slaughtering animals for food. Be realistic about life-and-death decisions. But most of all, be realistic about their needs. Wolves and bison need huge spaces to roam. Cows and horses need pastures for grazing. Dogs are social animals and need lots of attention. As you enter a career working with animals, try to be realistic when meeting the needs of each animal in your care.<br> <br><br> <br>Quiz: Am I Cut Out to Work with Animals?<br> <br>Let&#x2019;s take a quick quiz and see if you should read on and discover all the fascinating careers available working with animals.<br> <br>1.&nbsp;When an animal pees or poops on the floor, I . . .<br> <br>a.&nbsp;Get a bucket and mop and clean it up.<br> <br>b.&nbsp;Find someone and tell them that the animal made a mess.<br> <br>c.&nbsp;Squeal and run away.<br> <br><br> <br>2.&nbsp;An unknown dog is running loose in my neighborhood.

All that we are is the result of what we have thought. It is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. -the Dhammapada What has gone before in your life has most probably convinced you, first, that the statement &#34;Everything that happens to me is the best possible thing that can happen to me&#34; is not true and cannot be true and, second, that a book based in part on that premise is not going to do you much good. It may seem futile to even attempt to put that to the test. But this is a new day. We have begun a new century and a new millennium, and you may discover in reading this book that it is your time to take on a new belief that will bless your life from this time onward. We are the authors of every next moment. We are powerful beings, creating our futures with our thoughts and actions. We are the mechanism by which life is controlled, and we control the events in our life by our personal philosophy, which determines how we respond to those events. Each of us has a personal philosophy, but few of us have defined what it is. Although you may have never sat down and defined what your philosophy is, it is fully operative and working in your life at all times. It deals with what you believe about the world in which you live, about its people and events, about how events and circumstances affect you, and about how you affect them. If you were asked about your philosophy of life in general, you might say, &#34;Life is great, good things happen to me, I&#39;m a lucky person, and I believe the world is a wonderful place with wonderful people in it.&#34; Or you might say just the opposite: &#34;I&#39;m unlucky, bad things happen to me, the world isn&#39;t a very nice place, people take advantage of me, and they&#39;re just out for what they can get.&#34; You might believe in Murphy&#39;s law-&#34;If anything can go wrong, it will.&#34; Many people say that bad accidents happen, that unfairness is not only possible but likely. They say that real happiness is hard to come by and usually short-lived, that we come into the world, live, and die and what we experience in between is mostly a struggle and a continual compromise between what we want and what we get. Because that is what people have generally believed, their actions have been based on that belief and, as a result of natural law, they have brought about that end. Then they have said, &#34;I told you so.&#34;</p><h2>Institut Paul Bocuse Gastronomique: The definitive step-by-step guide to culinary excellence</h2><p><br>The perfect guide for professional chefs in training and aspiring amateurs, this fully illustrated, comprehensive step-by-step manual covers all aspects of preparing, cooking and serving delicious, high-end food. <br> <br>This authoritative reference book covers 250 core techniques in extensive, ultra-clear step-by-step photographs.

Axel Vervoordt�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s intense curiosity has fueled his work as an interior designer, spurring him to explore and draw inspiration from cultures around the globe. He was first exposed to Eastern art and philosophy years ago, but today it has become the guiding principle in his work, particularly the concept of Wabi. Developed in the twelfth century, Wabi advocates simplicity and humility, the rejection of all that is superfluous or artificial. Through extraordinary photographs from Japan and Korea to Belgium and Switzerland, Vervoordt invites us to explore the elements that inspire him: natural materials and time-worn objects that evoke the essence of Wabi. Today, together with the Japanese architect Tatsuro Miki, Vervoordt carries the principles of Wabi into his remarkable interiors. As Vervoordt reveals how he infuses his current creations with a fundamentally oriental approach, interiors devotees will gain new insight from this tribute to the designer�&#x20ac;&#x2122;s latest sources of inspiration for the home.</p><p>Axel Vervoordt is an antiques and art dealer in Belgium. His work is internationally renowned, and he regularly organizes exhibitions at fairs, museums, and art and antique biennials. Flammarion published Axel Vervoordt: Timeless Interiors in 2007. Michael Paul, a New Zealand native based in London, is a lifestyle photographer and writer. Tatsuro Miki is a Japanese architect based in Brussels. Laziz Hamani&#x2019;s photographs have been featured in solo exhibitions and have been published in numerous books including Dior, Antiquaires: The Finest Antique Dealers in Paris, and Axel Vervoordt: The Story of a Style."Legendary Belgium antiquarian and art collector Axel Vervoordt&#x2019;s interiors represent some of the most coveted rooms from layered and luxurious to monastic and minimal, reflecting the influence he derived from the Buddhist principle of &#x201c;contradiction.&#x201d; In <i>Wabi Inspirations</i> (Flammarion) Vervoordt, a student of Zen, gives his personal take on an ascetic developed in the twelfth century that advocates simplicity, authenticity, and imperfection. Vervoordt, working with Japanese architect Tatsuro Miki, uses natural materials to maximum effect as brilliantly seen in 350 dazzling color illustrations." ~VANDM.com</p><h2>If I Ran the Rain Forest: All About Tropical Rain Forests (Cat in the Hat&#39;s Learning Library)</h2><p>The Cat in the Hat takes Sally and Dick for an &#x201c;umbrella-vator&#x201d; ride through the understory, canopy, and emergent layers of a tropical rain forest, encountering a host of plants, animals, and native peoples along the way.</p><p>he Hat takes Sally and Dick for an &#x201c;umbrella-vator&#x201d; ride through the understory, canopy, and emergent layers of a tropical rain forest, encountering a host of plants, animals, and native peoples along the way.<b>Bonnie Worth</b> is the author of countless books for young readers, among them 18 of the Cat in the Hat's Learning Library books, including&nbsp;<i>Oh Say Can You Say Di-No-Saur?</i>,<i> If I Ran the Rain Forest</i>,<i> Oh Say Can You Seed?</i>&nbsp;(winner of the 2003 Ohio Farm Bureau Award),&nbsp;<i>Hark!

Two proud but very different men, they enlist with the Ranger troop in pursuit of Buffalo Hump, the great Comanche war chief; Kicking Wolf, the celebrated Comanche horse thief; and a deadly Mexican bandit king with a penchant for torture. Assisting the Rangers in their wild chase is the renowned Kickapoo tracker, Famous Shoes. <br> <i>Comanche Moon</i> closes the twenty-year gap between <i>Dead Man's Walk</i> and <i>Lonesome Dove,</i> following beloved heroes Gus and Call and their comrades in arms -- Deets, Jake Spoon, and Pea Eye Parker -- in their bitter struggle to protect the advancing West frontier against the defiant Comanches, courageously determined to defend their territory and their way of life.</p><p>In a book that serves as a both a sequel to <i>Dead Man's Walk</i> and a prequel to the beloved <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, McMurtry fills in the missing chapters in the Call and McCrae saga. It is a fantastic read, in many ways the best and gutsiest of the series. We join the Texas Rangers in their waning Indian-fighting years. The Comanches, after one last desperate raid led by the fearsome-but-aging Buffalo Hump, are almost defeated, though Buffalo Hump's son, Blue Duck, still terrorizes the relentless flow of settlers and lawmen. As Augustus and Woodrow follow one-eyed, tobacco-spitting Captain Inish Scull deep into a murderous madman's den in Mexico, their thoughts turn toward the end of their careers and the women they love in remarkably different ways back in Austin. What's amazing about McMurtry's West is that he sees beyond the romance. Neither his Indians, his cowboys, his gunslingers, nor his women act the way they did in either Zane Grey novels or John Wayne movies. Incredible beauty and lightning-quick violence are the bookends of his West, but it is the in-between moments of suffering and boredom where McMurtry shines. The suffering is poignant and heart-rending; the boredom tempered with doses of Augustus McCrae's sharp humor. Don't be surprised if you find yourself crying and laughing on the same page.<p>A brilliant and haunting novel richly capable of standing on its own. <i>Comanche Moon</i> completes Larry McMurtry's epic cycle of novels of the American West that began with the Pulitzer-Prize-winning masterpiece, Lonesome Dove. </p><p>We join Texas Rangers August McCrae and Woodrow F.

Trees, they tell us, can live without us, but we cannot live without them. Not only do trees provide us with the oxygen we breathe, food gathered from their branches, and wood for both fuel and shelter, but they have been essential to the spiritual and cultural life of civilizations around the world.<br><br> From Luna, the Coastal Redwood in California that became an international symbol when activist Julia Butterfly Hill sat for 738 days on a platform nestled in its branches to save it from logging, to the Bodhi Tree, the sacred fig in India that is a direct descendent of the tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment, Cook and Jenshel reveal trees that have impacted and shaped our lives, our traditions, and our feelings about nature. There are also survivor trees, including a camphor tree in Nagasaki that endured the atomic bomb, an American elm in Oklahoma City, and the 9/11 Survivor Tree, a Callery pear at the 9/11 Memorial. All of the trees were carefully selected for their role in human dramas.<br><br> This project both reflects and inspires awareness of the enduring role of trees in nurturing and sheltering humanity.

It features images taken by photographers Diane Cook and Len Jenshel, who spent two years travelling the globe to snap pictures of 59 extraordinary trees.&#34; Daily Mail &#34;Landscape photographers Diane Cook and Len Jenshel spent two years travelling to 59 locations across five continents to photograph some of the world&#39;s most historic trees. Their work is documented in the book, Wise Trees. While we pass many trees every day, we rarely stop to appreciate their beauty and significance. The book is an ode to trees - they can live without us, but we cannot live without them. Not only do they provide us with the oxygen we breathe, food gathered from their branches, and wood for both fuel and shelter, but they have been essential to the spiritual and cultural life of civilisations around the world.

Seniors take your lunch money. Girls you&#x2019;ve known forever are suddenly beautiful and unattainable. And you can never get enough sleep. Could there be a worse time for Scott&#x2019;s mother to announce she&#x2019;s pregnant? Scott decides high school would be a lot less overwhelming if it came with a survival manual, so he begins to write down tips for his new sibling. Meanwhile, he&#x2019;s trying his best to capture the attention of Julia, the freshman goddess. In the process, Scott manages to become involved in nearly everything the school has to offer. So while he tries to find his place in the confusing world of high school, win Julia&#x2019;s heart, and keep his sanity, Scott will be recording all the details for his sibling&#x2019;s&#x2014;and your&#x2014;enjoyment.<br><br></p><p>David Lubar is the author of many popular novels for young readers, including <i>Hidden Talents</i> and <i>Dunk.</i> He has also published many short stories in young adult anthologies.

To cope with the expected (friends dumping him) and unexpected (mom's pregnant!) changes of his first year of high school, Scott keeps a diary in the guise of writing advice to "Smelly," his unborn brother. Full Cast Audio evokes the humorous growing pains of Scott, his friends, and family. Ryan MacConnell does an especially good turn at portraying Scott as a smart, wry young man wondering how to convert these unpopular traits into assets. Light music separates narration from epistolary episodes, and a catchy jazz phrase indicates new chapters. This excellent production will keep all listeners awake, even sleeping freshmen.

Written originally for warriors and samurai in a completely different time and culture, Musashi&#39;s book provides a remarkable source of inspiration for self-development today. His teachings are concise and to the point. He uses phrases like &#34;you must understand this&#34; and &#34;you must practice diligently&#34; and explains only general, but unquestionable and fundamental, concepts of the Way of the Warrior. While some of his guidelines are are not directly applicable in our time and age, those about striving to achieve improvement on the inside as well as the outside couldn&#39;t be more on target. Taken literally this book is about how to become an efficient, albeit enlightened, killer. It&#39;s value comes from reading between the lines--lines which speak volumes.</p><p>Miyamoto Musashi (1584&#x2013;1645), was a Japanese swordsman and ronin. Musashi, as he was often simply known, became renowned through stories of his excellent swordsmanship in numerous duels, even from a very young age. The founder of a style of swordsmanship, he also wrote The Book of Five Rings, a book on strategy, tactics, and philosophy that is still studied today. Miyamoto Musashi is widely considered a Kensei and one of the greatest warriors of all time.</p><h2>I Am Perfectly Designed</h2><p><p><b><i>I Am Perfectly Designed </i>is an exuberant celebration of loving who you are, exactly as you are, from Karamo Brown, the Culture Expert of Netflix's hit series <i>Queer Eye</i>, and Jason Brown&#x2015;featuring illustrations by Anoosha Syed.</b></p><p>In this empowering ode to modern families, a boy and his father take a joyful walk through the city, discovering all the ways in which they are perfectly designed for each other.</p><p>"With tenderness and wit, this story captures the magic of building strong childhood memories.

Marc Brown lives with his family in Tisbury, Massachusetts, on Martha's Vineyard.A well-intentioned but less than satisfactory picture book on sex education for primary-grade children, from the team behind Dinosaurs Die (1996), and other guides. In simple words and drawings, the book covers anatomical differences (both external and internal) between boys and girls; rudimentary facts about sexual behavior (including masturbation), pregnancy, and birth; and information about ``good'' touching and ``bad'' touching. Set on a nearly impossible course, the book errs by providing both too much information and too little. Certain structures (e.g., clitoris, seminal vesicles, foreskin) are mentioned in the text or shown in diagrams with no further explanation. Intercourse is defined as ``when a man and woman fit his penis into her vagina,'' but the diagrams of the male and female organs make such a ``fit'' inconceivable. That sperm and egg meet during intercourse is clear, but ejaculation and the motility of sperm are not mentioned, possibly giving rise to some alarming speculations about the mechanics of coitus. In the section about ``bad touch'' the child is advised to ``speak up and tell him or her to stop. If that doesn't work, tell your mom or dad or another grown-up.'' A responsible adult should be informed of any inappropriate touching. The laudable ambition--to make it easier for parents to talk with their children--is only partially realized.

In 1240, the Mongols invaded from the east, and for the next seven centureies, Ukraine was split between warring neighbors: Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Austrians, and Tatars. Again and again, borderland turned into battlefield: during the Cossack risings of the seventeenth century, Russia's wars with Sweden in the eighteenth, the Civil War of 1918&#x2013;1920, and under Nazi occupation. Ukraine finally won independence in 1991, with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Bigger than France and a populous as Britain, it has the potential to become one of the most powerful states in Europe.In this finely written and penetrating book, Anna Reid combines research and her own experiences to chart Ukraine's tragic past. Talking to peasants and politicians, rabbis and racketeers, dissidents and paramilitaries, survivors of Stalin's famine and of Nazi labor camps, she reveals the layers of myth and propaganda that wrap this divided land. From the Polish churches of Lviv to the coal mines of the Russian-speaking Donbass, from the Galician shtetlech to the Tatar shantytowns of Crimea, the book explores Ukraine's struggle to build itself a national identity, and identity that faces up to a bloody past, and embraces all the peoples within its borders.</p><p>Borderland tells the story of Ukraine.

Zoom from an Egyptian pyramid to an exotic jungle to a sandy beach. But if you think you know where you are, guess again. For in Istvan Banyai&#39;s mysterious landscapes of pictures within pictures, nothing is ever as it seems.</p><p>Istvan Banyai (http://www.ist-one.com) was born and educated in Budapest, Hungary. He is a commercial illustrator and animator whose works has appeared in numerous newspapers and magazines and on album covers. Mr. Banyai lives in Connecticut.Kindergarten-Grade 5?This remarkable companion to Zoom (Viking, 1995) is a visual journey, a cinematic picture book without words. Viewers are shown something that turns out to be just a piece of something larger, and thus not at all what they saw (or thought they saw) in the first place. With each page, one takes a step back to see the broader context. The image of an ancient archer is just a figure on a watch, the hand wearing the watch is making a rubbing in an Egyptian tomb, which turns out to be the Obelisk of Luxor in Paris, but not really because it's just a movie set...and on and on and on, until the final page, where the lights of a subway car disappear into a tunnel to become two eyes staring in the darkness?or so it appears. While not the most technically accomplished artist, Banyai makes up for it in originality, an assured sense of design and composition, and an avant-garde sensibility that children, especially older ones, will love. He mixes traditional and contemporary images in a sly way: for example, one picture shows a woman in traditional Japanese garb, wearing a walkman, looking right at viewers with a trace of a smile on her face. His is a truly global view, moving easily from Europe to Asia to the U.S. (although you never really know where you are). Children?small people in an adult-sized world?are often fascinated with size and perspective. Re-Zoom comments on that, on reality and illusion, on visual awareness, on all sorts of things. A fun book with a lot to "say"?all in all, a valuable addition.?Lauralyn Persson, Wilmette Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Haunted House (Choose Your Own Adventure - Dragonlark)</h2><p><p><strong>The Haunted House</strong> by R.

In our own ability, we cannot stand in the face of adversity. Without faith we could never find the strength to trust God. We would never be able to see above the trials we meet and to keep our eyes focused on the King while counting our trials as joy. This is the essence of James.

That&#x2019;s what author and pastor A.W. Tozer asked some 70 years ago when he wrote The Pursuit of God during an all-night train ride from Chicago to a speaking engagement in McAllen, Texas. Tozer began writing early in the evening, had a dinner of toast and tea around 9 p.m., and finished The Pursuit of God at 7:30 the next morning. He had penned a classic. &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;[F]or millions of Christians ... God is no more real than He is to the non-Christian,&#x201d; Tozer wrote. &#x201c;They go through life trying to love an ideal and be loyal to a mere principle.&#x201d;</p><p>But Tozer -- who spent hours each week praying -- said there is hope for those who hunger for and pursue God: &#x201c;We need never shout across the spaces to an absent God. He is nearer than our own soul, closer than our most secret thoughts.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>The Pursuit of God is for those who want to know God more -- his holiness, his riches, his love -- and to worship Him as did the saints of Scripture. </strong></p><p>In 10 concise chapters, Tozer explores the &#x201c;mysterious depths&#x201d; of God like few authors can while using plain, practical language anyone can understand. Each chapter concludes with a prayer by Tozer and reflection/discussion questions. &nbsp;</p><p>Do you desire to know God? To have inward peace like never before? To see your faith refreshed and renewed? To have your life transformed by a walk with God you didn&#x2019;t think was possible? </p><p>The Pursuit of God is a life-changing book for lay people, missionaries and pastors alike. It is a book that will challenge you, encourage you and inspire you.

Pick up this book today to find hope, peace, and healing now and for eternity.</strong> </p></p><p>A. W. Tozer (1897-1963) was an American Christian pastor, preacher, author, magazine editor, Bible conference speaker, and spiritual mentor. For his work, he received two honorary doctorate degrees. Among the more than 40 books that he authored, at least two are regarded as Christian classics: The Pursuit of God and The Knowledge of the Holy. His books impress on the reader the possibility and necessity for a deeper relationship with God. Living a simple and non-materialistic lifestyle, he and his wife, Ada Cecelia Pfautz, never owned a car, preferring bus and train travel. Even after becoming a well-known Christian author, Tozer signed away much of his royalties to those who were in need. Tozer had seven children, six boys and one girl. He was buried in Ellet Cemetery, Akron, Ohio, with a simple epitaph marking his grave: &#34;A. W. Tozer - A Man of God.&#34; Prayer was of vital personal importance for Tozer. His preaching as well as his writings were but extensions of his prayer life. He had the ability to make his listeners face themselves in the light of what God was saying to them.</p><h2>Warriors: The New Prophecy #6: Sunset</h2><p><p><strong>Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series continues with the sixth book in the New Prophecy series!</strong></p><p>The sixth book in this second series, <em>Warriors: The New Prophecy #6: Sunset,</em> brings more adventure, intrigue, and thrilling battles to the epic world of the warrior Clans.</p><p>As shadows of the past continue to plague the forest, Brambleclaw is haunted by a dark figure on a dangerous quest for revenge, and must struggle to remain true to his Clan.

While the snarky first-person narrator tries to distract listeners, it�s these characters who captivate.

He is also the brother of Wyatt Cullen, who quarterbacked his team to the Texas State Championship last season--not to mention the son of former NFL quarterback and local legend, Troy Cullen. To be a Cullen in Texas is to be football royalty . . . which leaves 14-year-old Jake in a Texas-sized shadow. Being a good teammate comes naturally to Jake; being a winner and a celebrity does not. Jake may be a Cullen, and he may play quarterback, but he is not his brother or his father.&nbsp; He's just like every other kid: fighting for every ounce of respect, awkward around a pretty girl, in awe of his famous family, and desparate to simultaneously blend in and cast his own shadow. Inspired by the real-life Manning family of quarterbacks and set amid the football-crazy culture of Texas, QB 1 is a coming-of-age story perfect for the fan of MILLION-DOLLAR THROW and HEAT.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Mike Lupica </b>is the author of multiple bestselling books for young readers, including <i>Heat, Travel Team, Million-Dollar Throw, and The Underdogs. </i>He has carved out a niche as the sporting world&#x2019;s finest storyteller.

State championship on the line, the new 1AA championship for small schools like yours. One of those small-town, big-dream schools. Like you were the one in the book or the TV show and you were playing for Friday Night Lights High.<br>&nbsp;</p>Only this was your school, the Granger High Cowboys, against Fort Carson, in Boone Stadium, the fancy new stadium at Texas State University.<br>Fort Carson ahead, 20&#x2013;16. Cowboys&#x2019; ball at their own twenty-yard line.<br><br>One time-out left.<br><br>Even if you were a high school senior, already had a college scholarship in your pocket to the University of Texas, even if you could see yourself in the pros someday, there was no way to know if it would be exactly like this for you ever again&#x2014;one shot like this with it all on the line.<br><br>Unless you were somebody like Eli Manning, and you got to do it twice, in the Super Bowl, the way Eli had done it twice to the Patriots. Eli: bringing his team from behind in the biggest football game there was, winning both of those Super Bowls in the last minute, something no one&#x2014;not even Eli&#x2019;s big brother Peyton&#x2014;had done in the history of the National Football League.<br><br>But the quarterback in Boone Stadium now wasn&#x2019;t a Manning. It was Wyatt Cullen. Son of Troy Cullen, who&#x2019;d been the greatest quarterback to come out of this part of Texas&#x2014;at least until his son Wyatt came along.<br><br>Around here, people lived out their dreams through their high school football stars. All the ones who&#x2019;d grown up in Granger and knew they&#x2019;d probably die there wanted to know why you&#x2019;d ever want to be one of those Manning brothers when you could be a Cullen in Granger, Texas.<br>Now Wyatt: in his senior year, in the last high school game he was ever going to play, his last chance to be a total high school hero and win the state title in the last minute the way his dad had once.<br><br>Like Wyatt was born to do it, born for this kind of moment, with what felt like the whole town of Granger in the stands on their side of the field.<br><br>Some sportswriter would quote Wyatt later as saying he imag�ined every pickup in their town was parked outside Boone Sta�dium, like there had been some kind of caravan of pickups all the way from Granger to here, to the kind of big game that made a small town like Granger feel like the capital of the whole world.<br><br>First down pass for him, left side, the kind of deep-out-pattern throw you needed a big arm to make, the throw all the scouts wanted to see and had been seeing from Wyatt since he became Granger&#x2019;s starter as a freshman. This one was to Wyatt&#x2019;s favorite receiver, Calvin Morton, a sophomore with big speed and big hands, tall as a tight end at six five, but skinny as a fence post. Gain of twenty to Calvin right out of the rodeo chute, as Wyatt&#x2019;s dad liked to say.<br><br>Ball on the forty, just like that. Room for Wyatt to maneuver now. Room to breathe. Clock stopped when Calvin went out of bounds. Minute fifty remaining.<br><br>All day.<br><br>Everybody standing in Boone Stadium. All those familiar faces on the Granger side, Dad and Mom pretty much in the same spot they had for home games at Granger High, fifty-yard line, maybe ten rows up. All the other Friday nights and Saturday afternoons had built up to this one. Cheerleaders on the field in the big area between the wall of the stands and the Cowboys&#x2019; bench, not doing much cheering right now, almost like they were frozen in place, all those pretty girls watching along with everybody else to see how the big game would come out.<br><br>Sarah Rayburn, the only freshman on the squad, she was that pretty, looking so scared and so nervous you were afraid she might be about to cry, even with that cheerleader smile of hers locked in place.<br><br>Wyatt went right back to Calvin on the next play. Fort Carson&#x2019;s pass rush made Wyatt work this time, flushing him out of the pocket, same kind of pressure they&#x2019;d been putting on him all day. But Wyatt bought himself just enough time, scrambling to his right. Wyatt was as accurate on the run with that arm as if he had all day in the pocket and hit Calvin in stride at midfield.<br><br>Clock running.<br><br>Wyatt hurried everybody up to the new line of scrimmage, going with the second play he&#x2019;d called in the huddle, a right side�line route to his tight end, Roy Gilley. Another strike, Roy shoved out of bounds by their strong safety.<br><br>One minute, one second left.<br><br>Next came the play they&#x2019;d talk about for a long time in Granger, in the ice-cream parlors and barbecue joints where they all grew up, where the only thing they talked about all week in those places, and on the town&#x2019;s lone radio station, was last week&#x2019;s game.<br><br>Wyatt Cullen, number 10, in that Cowboy blue that matched the blue of the Dallas Cowboys, surrounded this time, huge pres�sure now, one of the defensive linemen with a handful of blue jer�sey, trying to fight off a blocker and pull Wyatt down with his free hand.<br><br>The action actually seemed to stop in that moment, everybody saying afterward that they were sure Wyatt was getting sacked, guys on both teams saying they kept waiting for the ref to blow his whistle.<br><br>But he didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Because Wyatt wasn&#x2019;t about to go down.<br><br>Instead he stumbled as he somehow freed himself of the guy&#x2019;s grasp and left the pocket, pulling free, getting free, running for his life to his left.<br><br>Half the Fort Carson defense still coming for him.<br><br>But Wyatt wasn&#x2019;t looking behind him, he was looking down the field. Having bought himself just enough time to do that, Wyatt was able to fling the ball while running, barely taking long enough to plant his right foot, heaving it half-sidearm as far as he could in the direction of Calvin Morton.<br><br>Letting it rip even though Calvin was double-covered by a cor�ner and a safety. Wyatt told everybody later that he&#x2019;d overcooked the sucker on purpose, that&#x2019;s why it looked like an overthrow as it started to fall out of the sky, Wyatt wanting Calvin to be the only one with a chance to go up and get it.<br><br>And there was Calvin, going up for that pass like this was the way he&#x2019;d drawn it up in his dreams.<br><br>The safety and the corner could both jump pretty good. Yet not like Calvin Morton, who went up and outfought both of them, bobbling the ball just slightly, somehow pinning it to the front of his right shoulder pad with his huge mitt of a left hand.<br><br>Landing hard on his back, helmet going sideways as he did, somehow maintaining control of the ball.<br><br>Now there was Wyatt racing down the field, maybe as fast as he&#x2019;d ever moved on a football field, waving his teammates to run with him. Not wanting to burn that last time-out in his pocket, wanting everybody lined up as soon as the ref started the clock again, having stopped it because of the first down.<br><br>He spiked the ball as soon as it was snapped to him. Twenty-eight seconds left. Ball on the Fort Carson seventeen.<br><br>Wyatt figured he had all the time he needed, even if they didn&#x2019;t make another first down, that he could make four throws to the end zone, easy, if he had to.<br><br>But he needed only one.<br><br>Needed only one because Calvin made this sweet, tight inside move on the corner, like he was going to run a post, then just flat froze the guy and the safety giving inside help when he made an even better cut, at full speed, toward the left corner of the end zone.<br><br>Wyatt&#x2019;s pass, dead spiral, hit those big hands as softly as your head hitting your pillow, and it was 22&#x2013;20, Granger.<br><br>Now it had become the high school moment, in Texas or any�where else, they had all really dreamed about their whole lives, going ahead in the last seconds of the big game like this.<br><br>Couldn&#x2019;t tell it by watching Wyatt Cullen, though. He was the coolest guy in Boone Stadium, pointing up to where his parents and his kid brother were, all of them losing their minds the way everybody around them was.<br><br>There was Sarah, the close-up of her face they&#x2019;d use not only in the TV highlights, but also in the Granger Dispatch, looking about as happy as a high school girl ever could, eyes on Wyatt.<br><br>There was old Coach John McCoy, his Granger jacket halfway zipped the way it always was, no matter how hot the Texas weather was, showing you the white shirt and the tie he always wore, had worn since he coached Troy Cullen in games like these. Coach getting some love from the TV cameras his own self, as they liked to say in Texas, calmly holding up one finger, not saying the Cowboys were already number one, not getting ahead of him�self, just telling his boys to kick the point after.<br>Clay Smolders&#x2019;s kick was center cut. Now it was 23&#x2013;20 for Granger.<br><br>Fort Carson managed to get off three desperation heaves. When the last one fell harmlessly to the ground at around the Granger forty, it was over.<br><br>Then Wyatt Cullen was in the air, above it all, carried around by the bigger guys on his team. Even looking cool up there, above the action now instead of in the middle of it. Smiling when the cameras closed on him, like he was exactly where he was sup�posed to be, like he knew all along that this was the way his day and his high school career were supposed to end.<br>&nbsp;<br>His kid brother, Jake, froze the scene right there.<br><br>Hit the remote and froze his big brother on TiVo. Right there on the close-up, on Wyatt&#x2019;s smile. Like Wyatt really had known all along, since he first played catch with Troy Cullen in the pasture behind the barn, the first time Dad was the one telling him he had the arm.<br><br>Jake pointed the remote at the big screen, sat there in the quiet den, waiting for his buddies to come pick him up and head over to Mickey&#x2019;s Bar-B-Q tonight, wondering all over again what the view was really like up there for Wyatt. What it was like to actually be Wyatt Cullen, even though he&#x2019;d grown up in the same house with him, looked up to him his whole life.<br><br>Jake: wondering if he&#x2019;d ever get anywhere near a moment like that at Granger High.<br><br>Or if he&#x2019;d ever even be the first-string quarterback at Granger High, whether he was a Cullen or not.</p><h2>Tolkien Fantasy Tales Box Set (The Tolkien Reader/The Silmarillion/Unfinished Tales/Sir Gawain and the Green Knight)</h2><p>The ultimate companion to <i>The Hobbit</i> and The Lord of the Rings: a four-volume anthology of stories, poems, and archival material from the master of fantasy.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>This box set includes:</b><br> <b>THE TOLKIEN READER</b><br> <b>THE SILMARILLION</b><br> <b>UNFINISHED TALES</b><br> <b>SIR GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT</b></p><p><b>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien</b> was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa.

Our society places such faith in empirical reason, historical progress, and heartfelt emotion that it&#x2019;s easy to wonder: Why should anyone believe in Christianity? What role can faith and religion play in our modern lives?</b><br><br> In this thoughtful and inspiring new book, pastor and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Timothy Keller invites skeptics to consider that Christianity is more relevant now than ever. As human beings, we cannot live without meaning, satisfaction, freedom, identity, justice, and hope. Christianity provides us with unsurpassed resources to meet these needs. Written for both the ardent believer and the skeptic, <i>Making Sense of God</i> shines a light on the profound value and importance of Christianity in our lives.</p><p>Timothy Keller was born and raised in Pennsylvania and educated at Bucknell University, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and Westminster Theological Seminary. His first pastorate was in Hopewell, Virginia. In 1989 he started Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City with his wife, Kathy, and their three sons. Today, Redeemer has nearly six thousand regular Sunday attendees and has helped to start more than three hundred new churches around the world. He is the author of <i>God's Wisdom for Navigating Life, Hidden Christmas,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Songs of Jesus</i>,&nbsp;and <i>The Meaning of Marriage</i>, among others, including the perennial bestsellers <i>The Reason for God</i> and <i>The Prodigal God</i>.One<br><br><i>Isn't Religion Going Away?</i><br><br>You have picked up this book, which shows you have some interest in the question of whether religious belief is possible in our time. But really, should you keep reading? Isn't a book about the relevance of religion nothing but a desperate, rear-guard action? Isn't the greater reality that "nonbelief is on the march"? That religion in general and Christianity in particular are spent forces, inevitably declining? Aren't increasing percentages of the population, especially millennials, finding that they have less need for God and faith in their lives?<br><br>A woman in my church brought a colleague from the business world to visit a Sunday worship service. The man, in his late fifties, was stunned to see several thousand professionals present, mostly young and living in Manhattan. He found the service helpful, thought provoking, and even moving. Afterward he admitted to her that the experience was unnerving. Why, she asked? He answered: "It has always been a settled belief of mine that religion is dying out, at least among educated people and certainly among the young. Oh, I can understand young adults being attracted to the Christian rock-concert-type things. But my experience here puts something of a hole in that assumption."<br><br>After a major new study by the Pew Research Center, the <i>Washington Post</i> ran an article entitled "The World Is Expected to Become More Religious&#x2014;Not Less." While acknowledging that in the United States and Europe the percentage of people without religious affiliation will be rising for the time being, the article distilled the research findings, namely, that in the world overall religion is growing steadily and strongly. Christians and Muslims will make up an increasing percentage of the world's population, while the proportion that is secular will shrink. Jack Goldstone, a professor of public policy at George Mason University, is quoted: "'Sociologists jumped the gun when they said the growth of modernization would bring a growth of secularization and unbelief. . . . That is not what we're seeing,' he said. 'People . . . need religion.'"<br><br>Many readers of the <i>Washington Post </i>article had the same reaction as the man who had visited our church. They found the study's findings unbelievable. One opined, "It's easy to get rid of religion just by educating people about other religions, or even giving them a secular, non-biased look at the history of the religion that any given kid has been raised in." In other words, as long as education levels rise and modernization advances religion has to die out. In this view, people feel they need religion only if they are untutored in science, history, and logical thinking.<br><br>The Pew study, however, threatened these deeply held beliefs about why people are religious. Not long ago, leading scholars in Western society were also nearly unanimous in thinking that religion was inevitably declining. They thought the need for religion would go away as science provided explanations and aid against the natural elements better than God ever did. In 1966 John Lennon represented this consensus when he said, "Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and will be proved right."<br><br>However, this hasn't happened as advertised. As the Pew study proves, religion is on the rise, and the emergence of the more strident and outspoken "new atheists" may be in fact a reaction to the persistence and even resurgence of vibrant religion. Nor is the flourishing of faith happening only among less educated people. Over the last generation philosophers such as Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor, and Alvin Plantinga have produced a major body of scholarly work supporting belief in God and critiquing modern secularism in trenchant ways that are hard to answer.<br><br>Demographers tell us the twenty-first century will be less secular than the twentieth. There have been seismic religious shifts toward Christianity in sub-Saharan Africa and China while evangelicalism and Pentecostalism have grown exponentially in Latin America. Even in the United States the growth of the "nones" has been mainly among those previously identified but nominal or disengaged with a faith while the devoutly religious in the United States and Europe are growing.<br><br>Belief in God makes sense to four out of five people in the world and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. The immediate question is, then, why? Why does religion still grow amid so much secular opposition? Some might answer that most people in the world are simply undereducated, while others might be a bit more blunt and respond, "Because most people are idiots." But a more thoughtful, less misanthropic answer is in order. There are two good answers to the question of why religion continues to persist and grow. One explanation is that many people find secular reason to have "things missing" from it that are necessary to live life well. Another explanation is that great numbers of people intuitively sense a transcendent realm beyond this natural world. We will look at both of these ideas in turn.<br><br><i>An Awareness of Something Missing</i><br><br>Some years ago a woman from China was doing graduate work at Columbia University in political theory, and she began attending our church. She had come to the United States to study partially because there was a growing body of thought among Chinese social scientists that the Christian idea of transcendence&#x2014;that there was a supernatural reality&#x2014;was the historic basis for the concepts of human rights and equality. After all, she said, science alone could not prove human equality. I expressed surprise at this, but she said this was not only something that some Chinese academics were arguing, but that some of the most respected secular thinkers in the West were saying it too. Through her help, I came to see that faith was making something of a comeback in rarefied philosophical circles where secular reason&#x2014;rationality and science without any belief in a transcendent, supernatural reality&#x2014;has increasingly been seen as missing things that society needs.<br><br>One of the world's most prominent philosophers, J�rgen Habermas, was for decades a defender of the Enlightenment view that only secular reason should be used in the public square. Habermas has recently startled the philosophical establishment, however, with a changed and more positive attitude toward religious faith. He now believes that secular reason alone cannot account for what he calls "the substance of the human." He argues that science cannot provide the means by which to judge whether its technological inventions are good or bad for human beings. To do that, we must know what a good human person is, and science cannot adjudicate morality or define such a thing. Social sciences may be able to tell us what human life <i>is</i> but not what it ought to be. The dream of nineteenth-century humanists had been that the decline of religion would lead to less warfare and conflict. Instead the twentieth century has been marked by even greater violence, performed by states that were ostensibly nonreligious and operating on the basis of scientific rationality. Habermas tells those who are still confident that "philosophical reason . . . is capable of determining what is true and false" to simply look at the "catastrophes of the twentieth century&#x2014;religious fascist and communist states, operating on the basis of practical reason&#x2014;to see that this confidence is misplaced." Terrible deeds have been done in the name of religion, but secularism has not proven to be an improvement.<br><br>Evidence for Habermas's thesis comes from recent research on the history of the eugenics movement in the early twentieth century. Thomas C. Leonard of Princeton University shows that a century ago progressive, science-based social policies were broadly understood to entail the sterilization or internment of those persons deemed to have defective genes. In 1926 John T. Scopes was famously tried under Tennessee law for teaching evolution. Few people remember, however, that the textbook Scopes used, <i>Civic Biology</i> by George Hunter, taught not only evolution but also argued that science dictated we should sterilize or even kill those classes of people who weakened the human gene pool by spreading "disease, immorality, and crime to all parts of this country." This was typical of scientific textbooks of the time.<br><br>It was the horrors of World War II, not science, that discredited eugenics. The link between genetic makeup and various forms of antisocial behavior has never been disproved; indeed, the opposite is true. Recent studies, for example, show that a particular receptor gene decreased boys' likelihood to stay in school, even with compensatory support and help from teachers and parents. There are many other links of heredity to disease, addictions, and other problematic behavior. Thomas Leonard argues that "eugenics and race science were not pseudosciences in the . . . Progressive Era. They were sciences." It was perfectly logical to conclude that it would be more socially and economically cost effective if those genetically prone to nonproductive lives did not pass on their genetic code. However, the death camps aroused the moral intuition that eugenics, while perhaps scientifically efficient, is <i>evil</i>. Yet if you believe that it is, you must find support for your conviction in some source beyond science and the strictly rational cost-benefit analysis of practical reason. Where can you look for this support? Habermas writes: "The ideals of freedom . . . of conscience, human rights and democracy [are] the direct legacy of the Judaic ethic of justice and the Christian ethic of love. . . . To this day there is no alternative to it."<br><br>None of this denies that science and reason are sources of enormous and irreplaceable good for human society. The point is rather that science <i>alone</i> cannot serve as a guide for human society. This was well summarized in a speech that was written for but never delivered at the Scopes "monkey trial": "Science is a magnificent material force, but it is not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. . . . Science does not [and cannot] teach brotherly love." Secular, scientific reason is a great good, but if taken as the sole basis for human life, it will be discovered that there are too many things we need that it is missing.<br><br><i>Facing Death and Finding Forgiveness</i><br><br>A popular book that makes similar points is the best-selling <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i>, the reflections of a young neurosurgeon, now deceased, who wrote about a journey back toward faith when he was dying of cancer. Kalanithi had been an "ironclad atheist." His primary charge against Christianity was "its failure on empirical grounds. Surely enlightened reason offered a more coherent cosmos . . . a material conception of reality, an ultimately scientific worldview." But the problem with this whole conception became evident to him. If everything has to have a scientific explanation and proof, then this "is to banish not only God from the world but also love, hate, meaning&#x2014;to consider a world that is self-evidently <i>not</i> the world we live in."<br><br>All science can do, Kalanithi argues, is "reduce phenomena into manageable units." It can make "claims about matter and energy" but about nothing else. For example, science can explain love and meaning as chemical responses in your brain that helped your ancestors survive. But if we assert, which virtually everyone does, that love, meaning, and morals do not merely <i>feel</i> real but actually are so&#x2014;science cannot support that. So, he concluded, "scientific knowledge [is] inapplicable" to the "central aspects of human life" including hope, love, beauty, honor, suffering, and virtue.<br><br>When Kalanithi realized that there was no scientific proof for the reality of meaning and virtue, things he was sure existed, it made him rethink his whole view of life. If the premise of secularism led to conclusions he knew were not true&#x2014;namely that love, meaning, and morals are illusions&#x2014;then it was time to change his premise. He found it no longer unreasonable to believe in God. He came to a belief not only in God but also in "the central values of Christianity&#x2014;sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness&#x2014;because I found them so compelling." Paul Kalanithi had also found that, in Habermas's phrase, the completely secular point of view had too many things "missing" that he knew were both necessary and real.<br><br>Kalanithi refers in passing to forgiveness as one reason he left secularism behind. He does not elaborate but another account may shed light on this. Author and teacher Rebecca Pippert had the opportunity to audit some graduate-level courses at Harvard University, one of which was "Systems of Counseling." At one point the professor presented a case study in which therapeutic methods were used to help a man uncover a deep hostility and anger toward his mother. This helped the client understand himself in new ways. Pippert then asked the professor how he would have responded if the man had asked for help to forgive her. The professor responded that forgiveness was a concept that assumed moral responsibility and many other things that scientific psychology could not speak to. "Don't force your values . . . about forgiveness onto the patient," he argued. When some of the students responded with dismay, the professor tried to relieve the tension with some humor. "If you guys are looking for a changed heart, I think you are looking in the wrong department." However, as Pippert observes, "the truth is, we <i>are</i> looking for a changed heart." Secular reason, all by itself, cannot give us a basis for "sacrifice, redemption, and forgiveness," as Paul Kalanithi concluded in his final months.<br><br><i>A Sense of the Transcendent</i><br><br>A second reason why, even in our secular age, religion continues to make sense to people is more existential than intellectual. Harvard professor James Wood, in a <i>New Yorker</i> article "Is That All There Is?" tells of a friend, an analytic philosopher and a convinced atheist, who sometimes wakes in the middle of the night haunted by a visceral angst:<br><br><i>How can it be that this world is the result of an accidental big bang? How could there be no design, no metaphysical purpose? Can it be that every life-beginning with my own, my husband's, my child's, and spreading outward-is cosmically irrelevant?</i><br><br>Wood, who is a secular man himself, admits that "as one gets older, and parents and peers begin to die, and the obituaries in the newspaper are no longer missives from a faraway place but local letters, and one's own projects seem ever more pointless and ephemeral, such moments of terror and incomprehension seem more frequent and more piercing, and, I find, as likely to arise in the middle of the day as the night."<br><br>What is this "incomprehension" that can suddenly grip even secular persons? Wood's friend's questions reveal more an intuition than a line of reasoning. It is the sense that we are more and life is more than what we can see in the material world. Steve Jobs, when contemplating his own death, confessed that he felt that "it's strange to think that you accumulate all this experience . . . and it just goes away. So I really want to believe that something survives, that maybe your consciousness endures." It seemed to Jobs untrue to reality that, for something as significant as the human self, death would be just an "off switch," so it is merely "<i>Click!</i> And you're gone."</p><h2>You&#39;re Special (KJV 25-pack)</h2><p>You're Special <p>"There are no ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal," wrote C. S. Lewis. It's true--each one of us is a special creation of God.</p> <p>Believe it or not--no one else is just like you. Your physical appearance, your voice and personality traits--your habits, intelligence, personal tastes--all these make you one of a kind. Even your fingerprints distinguish you from every other human being--past, present, or future. You are not the product of some cosmic assembly line; you are unique.</p> <p>But the most important fact of your identity is that God created you in His own image (Genesis 1:27). He made you so you could share in His creation, could love and laugh and know Him person to person. You are special indeed!</p> <p>The Bible reveals God's total interest in you as an individual. The psalmist wrote in one of his most beautiful prayers, "I will praise Thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made" (Psalm 139:14). God knew you even before you were born. Then, and now, He has plans just for you, plans conceived in love.</p> <p>As we appreciate God's constant concern for us, we really begin to grasp the awfulness of sin. He loves you and me so much; yet how often we go our own way, turning our backs on Him. God's designs for our lives are then blocked; His mercies do not come to the unwilling.</p> <p>But even here we are precious to God, for He continues to love us even when we pay Him no mind. He still sees us as individuals with great value. No wonder the psalmist declared, "How precious are Thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great is the sum of them! If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand" (Psalm 139:17, 18). God is not an unfeeling, cold-hearted monarch of the heavens. He feels our pains; He shares our sorrows. He cares, and He considers each one of us important enough to love.</p> <p>In fact, He loves us so much that He gave His only Son to die for our sins. "Herein is love," the Bible says, "not that we loved God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the propitiation [full payment] for our sins" (1 John 4:10).</p> <p>Because you and I are special to God, He wants to forgive us and give us a full, meaningful life. When we trust in Jesus Christ and let Him put our lives together, the Bible says that we become "God's masterpieces, created in Christ Jesus" (Ephesians 2:10, paraphrase). Can anyone be more special than that?</p> <p>Yes, you are valuable to God! If you have never trusted Jesus Christ for your salvation, you can pray something like this today: </p> <p>Lord, thank You for sending Jesus Christ to die for my sins and rise from the dead so that I can know Your forgiveness and live with You forever. Right now I ask Him to be my Savior so that I can live as the special creation that You intended me to be.</p></p><p><p><strong>TED GRIFFIN</strong> is a former editor at Crossway Books and the author of numerous tracts, including the bestselling <em>You're Special</em>. </p></p><h2>Joyful Surrender: 7 Disciplines for the Believer&#39;s Life</h2><p>In our age of instant gratification and if-it-feels-good-do-it attitudes, self-discipline is hardly a popular notion.

That's how Katie Takeshima's sister, Lynn, makes everything seem. The sky is <i>kira-kira</i> because its color is deep but see-through at the same time. The sea is <i>kira-kira</i> for the same reason. And so are people's eyes. When Katie and her family move from a Japanese community in Iowa to the Deep South of Georgia, it's Lynn who explains to her why people stop on the street to stare. And it's Lynn who, with her special way of viewing the world, teaches Katie to look beyond tomorrow. But when Lynn becomes desperately ill, and the whole family begins to fall apart, it is up to Katie to find a way to remind them all that there is always something glittering -- <i>kira-kira</i> -- in the future.</p><p>In Cynthia Kadohata's lively, lovely, funny and sad novel -- winner of the 2005 Newbery Medal -- the Japanese-American Takeshima family moves from Iowa to Georgia in the 1950s when Katie, the narrator, is just in kindergarten. Though her parents endure grueling conditions and impossible hours in the non-unionized poultry plant and hatchery where they work, they somehow manage to create a loving, stable home for their three children: Lynn, Katie, and Sammy. Katie's trust in, and admiration for, her older sister Lynn never falters, even when her sisterly advice doesn't seem to make sense. Lynn teaches her about everything from how the sky, the ocean, and people's eyes are special to the injustice of racial prejudice. The two girls dream of buying a house for the family someday and even save $100 in candy money: "Our other favorite book was <i>Silas Marner</i>. We were quite capitalistic and liked the idea of Silas keeping all that gold underneath the floorboards." When Lynn develops lymphoma, it's heartbreaking, but through the course of her worsening illness, Katie does her best to remember Lynn's "<i>kira-kira</i>" (glittery, shining) outlook on life. Small moments shine the brightest in this poignant story; told beautifully and lyrically in Katie's fresh, honest voice.

From what not to eat a few days after giving birth (chicken wings) to the most effective ways to dodge post-partum sex, <i>Cat &amp; Nat&#x2019;s Mom Truths</i> shares everything no one will tell you about having kids.<br><br> Mixing memoir, humor, and advice, Cat and Nat tell never-before-told stories about the stress, guilt, joy, and laundry (oh the laundry!) of being a mom in their first book. With seven kids between them and millions of fans on social media, they get real about the parts of parenting that somehow don&#x2019;t make the Instagram feed. Sharing their outrageous humor, fearless myth-busting, and genuine comfort on every page, they walk you from pregnancy to the toddler years and beyond. And they dole out ridiculously honest advice, like what you think you need at the hospital when you have your first baby (lip gloss) versus what you actually need (hemorrhoid pillow), and how worried you should really be about germs (less than you are). Fearless crusaders against the perfection myth and all the gluten-free, sugar-free baking it entails, Cat and Nat assure you that you&#x2019;re already doing a great job, making this an essential companion for moms everywhere.</p><p>CATHERINE BELKNAP and NATALIE TELFER have been friends since they were teens but grew closer with motherhood when they chose to confide in each other about the more taboo topics of parenting. It wasn&#x2019;t long after that when they decided to bring the conversation online in hopes of helping other moms feel less isolated. Their rapidly exploding community of like-minded moms tune in every day to watch them rewrite the paradigm of &#x201c;the perfect mom.&#x201d; Cat &amp; Nat share everything moms think, but are too afraid to talk about.

We&#x2019;re so glad you&#x2019;re here with us. We are psyched to share our stories and our, um, wisdom with you.</p><p>If you have no clue who we are, well . . . where the heck to start?</p><p>We&#x2019;re Cat and Nat! On the surface, it can be a little hard to tell us apart: two moms, two blondes, two extroverts (the polite term for &#x201c;motormouths&#x201d;). Our names rhyme, just to make things even more confusing. So let&#x2019;s try to clear things up right off the bat:</p><p>A CAT &amp; NAT CHEAT SHEET</p><p>Who the heck is who?</p><p>Nat:<br>Long nails<br>Heels<br>Long flowing hair<br>Constantly lost and confused<br>Wine<br>Can drink Cat (and most men) under the table<br>Hates to drive, and almost never drives on the highway<br>Great chef and picks all the best restaurants<br>Phone is somehow always at 2% battery<br>Talks a lot<br><br>Cat:<br>Short nails<br>Flip-flops<br>Ponytail almost always<br>Always walks about a step ahead of Nat because Nat never knows where the hell she&#x2019;s going<br>Tequila<br>Gets drunk off one shot<br>Drives all the time because, well, someone has to<br>Orders McDonald&#x2019;s cheeseburgers without the meat<br>Phone is always fully charged for maximum Instagram readiness<br>Talks even more<br><br>We hung out a fair bit in high school, but we weren&#x2019;t BFFs. A decade later, we became the first of our group of friends to have kids, and we both found it so much to handle. We felt like failures a lot of the time. We stressed and we beat ourselves up. But we found comfort and confidence in one another.</p><p>Today, we are best friends who have seven (!) young kids between us. Nat has four and Cat has three&#x2014;although to be honest, it&#x2019;s usually just the nine of us together as a roaming pack of noise, mischief, and chaos. We live near each other in Toronto. We are married to guys named Mark and Marc. Yes, really. They hang out with each other, too, and we assume they spend most of their time talking about how lucky they are and how well they married. ;-)</p><p>We are not helicopter parents or Tiger Moms or whatever kind of overbearing mother is trendy right now. We are not parenting &#x201c;experts&#x201d; (whatever that means). We haven&#x2019;t studied at some fancy school. But we have been in the Mom trenches for a decade, and here&#x2019;s what we do know:</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know what it&#x2019;s like to hear your baby start wailing in the middle of the night, four minutes after you fed and changed her.<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know how it feels to ask yourself the question &#x201c;Is 4:30 p.m. too early to send the kids to bed?&#x201d;<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know the comedy of not being able to go to the bathroom without your children following along. You just want forty-five seconds to pee in peace and suddenly it&#x2019;s a family meeting in there!<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We know about husbands who want sex, and children who want a seventeenth bedtime story, and the other tightly wound moms out there who want to make you feel inferior because you didn&#x2019;t stay up until 2:00 a.m. baking organic, gluten-free, sugar-free, artisanal scones for the school bake sale.</p><p>In other words, we know the reality of motherhood. That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;ve written a book that&#x2019;s easy to pick up, easy to read&#x2014;and easy to put down when you hear the sound of one thousand Rice Krispies hitting the floor in the kitchen. Come back to us whenever you can find a free minute or two. We&#x2019;ll be here waiting.</p><p>We also know that being a mom can change who you are, and not always for the better. Like a lot of mothers, we went through a phase where we tried to mimic the seemingly perfect moms of the world. We became overanxious, overly controlling overanalyzers. Somehow, we managed to be incredibly self-conscious and to judge other moms at the same time! We had to let go of that nonsense, and we are here to help you do the same thing.</p><p>Lots of days, we felt like we were barely hanging on. Then we found each other--and, just as important, we found a new attitude. We started laughing at the absurdity of it all. We bonded over the hardships and the hilarity of motherhood. After a while, we kept coming back to the idea of helping other moms deal with the challenges and the stress and the isolation that motherhood can bring. That&#x2019;s why we started making our little videos. That&#x2019;s probably how you know us, those four-minute videos of us sitting in a car and talking--sometimes ranting . . . okay, usually ranting&#x2014;about motherhood and its challenges and frustrations and its awesome moments and whatever else comes into our heads. Sometimes we dance in the car. Often there are props. It can get a little crazy. And yes, from time to time, people who are walking by on the sidewalk stop and stare and snap a few photos of the two nutcases bopping around in a parked SUV.</p><p>It all grew from there. Now we are part of a community of women--moms who celebrate who they are, how they raise their kids, and how they treat themselves. We want to share that experience with you. We want you to join us. So be sure to hit us up on Facebook or Instagram and let us know what you think of the book. We are easy to find.</p><p>Our goal is to make you laugh when you&#x2019;re feeling low, inspire you when you&#x2019;re feeling overwhelmed, and reassure you when you&#x2019;re feeling defeated. We are not going to lecture you or make you feel bad about yourself or any of your decisions. (That&#x2019;s what the Internet is for!) We want to support you. We want to build people up. We want to make motherhood a sisterhood!</p><p>As we said earlier, we&#x2019;ve got seven kids between us. And here&#x2019;s the ridiculous thing: We still don&#x2019;t have all the answers. Not even close! We&#x2019;re figuring it out in real time. We&#x2019;re flailing and failing a lot of the time. So if you&#x2019;re looking for some flawless, superbrainy parenting advice, you are going to want to step slowly away from this book! But we&#x2019;ve got a lot of experiences to share, stories to tell, and maybe a few thousand mistakes to laugh about.</p><p>We are finally in a place where we can write the book that we desperately wanted to read when we first became mothers. An honest and candid book for mothers who don&#x2019;t necessarily have a Cat or a Nat to call up&#x2014;but want to know they&#x2019;re not alone. Something to help moms through the hard times. A book that says: The struggle is real. It&#x2019;s huge and it&#x2019;s overwhelming and it&#x2019;s disorienting. But you can do this. You can definitely do this.</p><p>We can do it together.</p><p>Okay, there&#x2019;s one last thing we want to tell you before we get started. In this book, we are going to talk a bit about husbands because we happen to be married to guys (and not to each other, as some people assume&#x2014;though we would make a hot, kick-ass couple). But when we mention our hubs, you can just sub in whatever applies to you: boyfriend, wife, life partner, girlfriend, significant other, full-size Ryan Reynolds cardboard cutout, whatever. We are down with however you live and whomever you love.&nbsp;</p><p>And we bow down to the single moms. Both Nat and I come from families where our parents split up and got divorced. And both of our mothers were extremely independent and self-reliant. That&#x2019;s where we both learned to respect the strength of an independent woman. It&#x2019;s awe-inspiring what women can accomplish without anyone&#x2019;s help. If you&#x2019;re on this journey without a partner, you&#x2019;re amazing.</p><p>All right, here we go! We don&#x2019;t have motherhood all figured out. But we are ready to get honest and real with you about the ridiculous, amazing, fulfilling, frustrating, life-altering, soul-stirring, headache-inducing gong show of being a mom--and all it brings in terms of pressures and pain and joy and frustration, fun and heartache and laundry. Don&#x2019;t get us started on the damn laundry!</p><p>And remember: It&#x2019;s gonna be okay. You&#x2019;re gonna be okay!</p></p><h2>The Theory of Money and Credit</h2><p>&#x201c;It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments.&#x201d; &#x2013; from <i>The Theory of Money and Credit</i><br><br>Originally published in 1912, Ludwig von Mises&#x2019;s <i>The Theory of Money and Credit</i> remains today one of economic theory&#x2019;s most influential and controversial treatises. Von Mises&#x2019;s examination into monetary theory changed forever the world of economic thought when he successfully integrated &#x201c;macroeconomics&#x201d; into &#x201c;microeconomics&#x201d; &#x2014;previously deemed an impossible task &#x2014;as well as offering explanations into the origin, value and future of money.<br><br>One hundred years later, von Mises and the Austrian school of economic theory are still fiercely debated by world economists in their search for the solution to America&#x2019;s current financial crisis. His theorems continue to inspire politicians and market experts who aim to raise up the common man and reduce the financial power of governments. In a preface added in 1952, von Mises urges the people of the world to see economic truth:<br><br>&#x201c;The great inflations of our age are not acts of God. They are man-made or, to say it bluntly, government-made. They are the off-shoots of doctrines that ascribe to governments the magic power of creating wealth out of nothing and of making people happy by raising the &#x2018;national income.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The best book on money ever written.&#x201d; &#x2014;Murray Rothbard, economist and historian<br><br>&#x201c;The greatest economist of the twentieth century.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sandeep Jaitly, economist<br></p><p>Ludwig von Mises (1881&#x2013;1973) was a preeminent philosopher and economist during the twentieth century.

She, in turn, is in love with Christian, a handsome but inarticulate and slow-witted suitor. Asked for help by Christian in wooing Roxane, Cyrano pours out his heart in romantic dialogues &#x2014; delivered under cover of night and dense foliage &#x2014; and through ardent love letters written in the name of Christian.<br>Presented here in a rich blank verse translation by poet Louis Untermeyer, this beloved romantic comedy will be warmly received by theater buffs as well as students and teachers of drama and literature.</p></p><p>Translated by Anthony Burgess.Edmond Rostand was born in Marseilles in 1868 and died in 1918. His thirty-year literary career is marked primarily by one astronomical success and a number of plays of lesser note. Early on, Edmond displayed an interest in marionette theater and poetry. While attending the College Stanislas in Paris, Rostand studied French literature, history, and philosophy. He followed his own inclination and deviated from the course his father had designed for him as a lawyer, although he did finally earn a legal degree and gain admission to the bar. His first poetry appeared in the small academy review Mireille. In 1888, his LeGantRouge was produced and, in 1890, Rostand published his first book of poetry, LesMusardises. His play LesRomanesques was produced in 1894, followed a year later by LaPrincessLointaine. The playwright's name and influence spread. Rostand's fame peaked in 1898 with the first production of CyranodeBergerac, a five-act verse drama. The play was important to the drama of its time for its romantic nature, a departure from the realistic conventions then in vogue. It was an enormous success. After his next success, L'Aiglon (1900), ten years followed before Rostand completed another play. He spent the remaining years of his life in semiretirement, and died in 1918.? <br> <br> <br> <i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Geeky Bartender Drinks: Real-Life Recipes for Fantasy Cocktails (Geeky Chef)</h2><p><b>Featuring nerdy recipes for both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages,&nbsp;</b><i><b>The Geeky Chef Drinks</b></i><b> is your chance to sip your way through your favorite sci-fi and fantasy worlds&#x2014;</b><i><b>Game of Thrones</b></i><b>, </b><i><b>Legend of Zelda</b></i><b>, </b><i><b>Star Trek</b></i><b>, and more.&nbsp;This smaller hardcover&nbsp;version of the original book has a new, fresh, modern&nbsp;design and includes 10 additional recipes from <i>The Geeky Chef Strikes Back</i>, making it the perfect gift for the geek in your life.</b><br><br> Author Cassandra Reeder has created authentic real-life drinks and cocktails inspired by your favorite fantasy drinks.

He lives in New York City.PreSchool-Grade 5&#x2014;Sabuda gives this classic tale of reversals of fortune and true love found a lovely and lavish retelling. The story unfolds with detail and drama in numerous small-size booklets adorned by illustrations and petite pop-ups. The 3-D sculptures featured center stage include an intricate rendition of the Beast's nook-and-crannied castle, a face-to-face close-up of his ferocious visage, and a bird's-eye view of an elegantly laid-out meal shared with Beauty. Stylishly attired in his gentleman's clothing, the Beast boasts fierce-looking features, sharpened-to-a-point golden-hued teeth and claws, and a spectacular scale-covered tail. The shimmering colors, thick black lines, and use of patterned shapes suggest stained glass, a fitting style for the tale's regal pacing and formal tone. The visual effects are innovative (e.g., readers pull up and peek into accordion-style castle corridors that convey a sense of depth) while also incorporating the story's themes (rose motifs appear throughout). It is fitting that the climactic spread features Beauty embracing the Beast beneath a trellis of blooming garden greenery (kids will have to open the final fold-out to see her beloved in his human form).

Yes. In this book is a model of Masculine groundedness that you can manifest in your relationship with a strong and capable woman. Such a woman doesn&#x2019;t settle for mediocre. She needs you to consistently follow through on your word, have purpose in life, remain grounded in the face of her intense emotion, make her feel safe, and provide leadership in the relationship. When that doesn&#x2019;t happen, she may start to drift. Things between you will start to feel flat, contentious, or even toxic. To you, she will seem to nag and criticize more, and have less interest in sex. When she gets really angry, you&#x2019;ll label it as &#x201c;crazy&#x201d; and blame her. But, in truth, she&#x2019;s just expressing the pain of you not stepping up. It is a relationship arc that is all too common. Fighting or defending yourself doesn&#x2019;t resolve anything. Withdrawing into work or your phone just makes it worse. And contorting yourself to avoid conflict just kills her respect for you.The answer is to develop and live from your Masculine core. This book shows you how in an actionable three-part framework: Respond vs. React, Provide Structure, and Create Safety. This is not the old model based on control, but a modern model based on clarity and leadership. This is not a manual for Alpha Dogs, nor a fuzzy spiritual guide. Rather, it is a clear set of principles that help you develop your Masculine leadership. And it doesn&#x2019;t take anything away from Feminine power. It is a blueprint for inspiring your woman&#x2019;s trust, lust, and devotion.</p><p></p><h2>Pete the Cat: Robo-Pete</h2><p><p><strong><em>New York Times&nbsp;</em>bestselling author and illustrator James Dean's latest Pete the Cat 8x8 storybook comes complete with stickers!</strong></p><p>When Pete's friends don't want to play the same games as he does, Pete has a great idea&#x2014;he'll build a robot that's just like him!

However, psychopharmacological treatment guidelines used for adults cannot simply be applied for children or adolescents, thus presenting clinicians and nurse practitioners with assessment and prescribing challenges. Based on the best selling resource Stahl&#39;s Prescriber&#39;s Guide, this new book provides a user friendly step by step manual on the range of psychotropic drugs prescribed for children and adolescents by clinicians and nurse practitioners. Reviewed by expert child and adolescent psychiatrists, the medications are presented in the same design format in order to facilitate rapid access to information. Each drug is broken down into a number of sections, each designated by a unique color background thereby clearly distinguishing information presented on therapeutics, safety and tolerability, dosing and use, what to expect, special populations, and the art of psychopharmacology, and followed by key references.</p><p>As the range of psychotropic medications in child and adolescent mental health continues to expand and change, this book provides an indispensable formulary in the field. With an easy-to-use, full-color, template-driven navigation system, it combines evidence-based data with clinically informed advice to support all psychiatric prescribers.Stephen M. Stahl is Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego and Honorary Visiting Senior Fellow in Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.

But instead, her ambitions land her in the clutches of a gang of unsavory pirates le by a devious magician. Her only hope is Natsu, a strange boy she happens to meet on her travels. Natsu&#x2019;s not your typical hero &#x2013; he gets motion sickness, eats like a pig, and his best friend is a talking cat. With friends like this, is Lucy better off with her enemies?</p><p>Hiro Mashima was born May 3, 1977, in Japan&#39;s Nagano prefecture. His series Rave Master has made him one of the most popular manga artists in America. Fairy Tail, currently being serialized in Weekly Shonen Magazine, is his latest creation.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;Lucy is a wizard who's looking to join the Fairy Tail Guild, which is famous for its members' out-of-control antics. When she meets Natsu, she never imagines that he's really Salamander of Fairy Tail. He spends much of his time as an ordinary guy who suffers from severe motion sickness in trains, boats, and even horse-drawn carriages. But when he taps into his magical abilities, he turns into an awesome fighter who uses fire to vanquish his enemies. By the end of the first volume, Lucy has joined the guild as well as Natsu and his flying cat as a team member. In the second volume, the team steals a magical book from the evil Duke Everlue and joins forces with Erza Scarlet to fight a guild that plans to use death-curse magic. Lucy and Natsu are the central figures in a large cast of characters, many of whom have unique abilities. Readers never see Erza's special skills in action, but it's clear that they involve lots of blood. The beings summoned by Lucy from the celestial spirit world are often temperamental and sometimes politically incorrect. The humor is often jaw-droppingly funny, meaning that the characters' jaws drop so low and so often that they look like something out of a Tex Avery cartoon. The illustrations are lively and keep the stories moving briskly. Each volume is filled with magic and humor and ends with a suspenseful cliff-hanger that will draw readers into the rest of the series.<i>&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Justice Sotomayor didn't have a lot growing up, but she had what she needed -- her mother's love, a will to learn, and her own determination. With bravery she became the person she wanted to be. With hard work she succeeded. With little sunlight and only a modest plot from which to grow, Justice Sotomayor <i>bloomed</i> for the whole world to see.<br> <br><i>Antes de que la magistrada de la Corte Suprema Sonia Sotomayor llegara al m�ximo tribunal de nuestra naci�n, no era m�s que una ni�ita en el South Bronx. La magistrada Sotomayor no tuvo mucho durante sus primeros a�os, pero s� tuvo lo que contaba -- el amor de su madre, la voluntad de aprender y su propia determinaci�n. Con valent�a se hizo la persona que quer�a ser. Con trabajo arduo triunf�. Con un poquito de sol en un solarcito donde crecer, la magistrada Sotomayor floreci� para que todo el mundo la vea.</i></p><p>Jonah Winter is the author of more than thirty celebrated nonfiction picture books including&nbsp;<i>Diego</i>, <i>The Secret Project</i>, and <i>Oil</i>, illustrated by Jeanette Winter;&nbsp;<i>Jazz Age Josephine</i>, illustrated by Marjorie Priceman;&nbsp;<i>Sonia Sotomayor: A Judge Grows in the</i>&nbsp;<i>Bronx</i>, illustrated by Edel Rodriguez;&nbsp;<i>The Founding Fathers!</i>&nbsp;illustrated by Barry Blitt; and&nbsp;<i>Lillian&#x2019;s Right to Vote: A Celebration of the Voting Rights Act of 1965</i>, illustrated by Shane W. Evans.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2013;Winter chronicles the life of the first Latina Supreme Court justice, from her childhood in the Bronx to her historic nomination. The tone is upbeat from its opening line: You never know what can happen. Sotomayor certainly had a lot of obstacles to overcome: poverty, juvenile diabetes, and the death of her father when she was nine. But Winter clearly identifies hard work, determination, and a loving extended family as the keys to her success. The author is honest about how her socioeconomic background sometimes made her feel alienated at Princeton University. The emphasis, though, is on her ability to thrive like a flowering vine that would not stop growing. Images of flowers blooming unify the text and the illustrations. Rodriguez's warm yellows and oranges also underscore the optimism of Winter's text. Moreover, the variety of media used (pastel, acrylic, spray paint, and oil-based paints) perfectly echoes the rich textures of Sotomayor's life. The Spanish translation is excellent and makes the book accessible to Latino families. Sotomayor's story can inspire children of all ethnic, racial, and economic backgrounds to work hard and pursue educational and professional success.<i>&#x2013;Mary Landrum, Lexington Public Library, KY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fast forward to today and you&#x2019;ll see the same picture, except I&#x2019;m taller and, I hope, a little wiser. As an avid reader, I feel incredibly lucky to write books for my favorite audience, children. As a mother, I feel great knowing that my books help parents with the hardest&#x2014;and absolutely most rewarding&#x2014;job on earth. I hope my books help put a smile on a child&#x2019;s face and give the feeling of &#x201c;I can do it!&#x201d; With the Toddler Tools series, I want to help families build life skills while they have fun reading together. During the toddler years, daily routines and transitions&#x2014;bedtime, naptime, clean-up time, and so on&#x2014;are big challenges, and every little success matters. The books are meant to take children and parents through familiar routines in a gentle, positive way. The simple language and colorful illustrations show toddlers learning new skills and celebrating success. Parents and caregivers can use the tips at the end to take the ideas further and personalize their routines. <br> <br> A note from the illustrator, Marieka Heinlen: <br> <br> As an illustrator, I always have two objectives. The first is to create artwork that truly engages young children. I try to see the world through their eyes, brimming with color and positivity. I keep my images bright, bold, and simple with fun details. Many people tell me kids like finding a paw waving among hands or a doll changing expression, little jokes just for them. The other goal is to try new mediums. I started with pencils and paints, moved into creating art electronically, and am currently playing with fabrics and collage. A lot of the vintage fabrics reminded me of my own childhood&#x2014;other readers may get that warm, fuzzy feeling from them as well. Making art for children is a joy, and using it to teach them is a privilege. <br>Elizabeth Verdick is the author of more than 30 highly acclaimed books for children and teenagers, including books in the Toddler Tools board book series, the Best Behavior series for young children, and the Laugh &amp; Learn&#x2122; series for preteens.

But as a child, Michael almost gave up on his hoop dreams, all because he feared he'd never grow tall enough to play the game that would one day make him famous. That's when his mother and father stepped in and shared the invaluable lesson of what really goes into the making of a champion -- patience, determination, and hard work. <br> Deloris Jordan, mother of the basketball phenomenon, teams up with his sister Roslyn to tell this heartwarming and inspirational story that only the members of the Jordan family could tell. It's a tale about faith and hope and how any family working together can help a child make his or her dreams come true.</p><p>Before basketball star Michael Jordan's name was uttered reverently in households all over the planet, young Michael was just a shrimpy kid trying to play ball with the big boys in the neighborhood. Tired of being teased by the biggest boy on the court, Michael is convinced the only solution is to grow taller. His mama smilingly suggests putting salt in his shoes and saying a prayer every night. His daddy tells young Michael that "Being taller may help you play a little better, but not as much as practice, determination, and giving your best will. Those are the things that make you a real winner." And so they are. At 6-foot-6, Michael may not have grown up to be the tallest player on the court, but he sure did turn out to be one of the best!<p> As his mother and his sister, Deloris Jordan and Rosalyn Jordan are in a pretty good position to tell us all about what made Michael a star. They create an image of a cozy, loving family life any child would be happy to come home to. Award-winning illustrator Kadir Nelson's oil pictures of the gangly little Michael with hyperlong arms and oversized hands capture the preteen potential as well as his gawky grace. This warm, uplifting story will encourage young readers to chase their dreams with hard work and faith.

Dogs are social creatures that readily adapt to dominance-subordination relationships. They prefer to live in groups, or &#x201c;packs,&#x201d; rather than alone. A bond of attachment formed among the pack members keeps the group together. But the bond by itself is not enough to maintain order in the group. There is also a leader and a chain of command.<br> &nbsp;<br> Canine pack relationships are based on a dominance hierarchy, or a descending &#x201c;pecking&#x201d; order. There is always one dog in each group that becomes the pack leader. <br> &nbsp;<br> The leader will dominate, establish organization, discipline the rest, and maintain group order. Other pack members rarely challenge the leader. Next in rank is the second-in-command. He or she is controlled only by the leader but, in turn, dominates all the pack members below in rank. Every member of the pack has a position in the hierarchy, and once these positions are established, each dog knows precisely which members are above him in rank and which are beneath him, and what his role is.<br> &nbsp;<br> In all the pack&#x2019;s activities in the wild, the leader firmly shows the other members that he is boss. He will take the initiative in play, and he will become the first to mate. He will eat first after a hunt, but once he has his fill, the other dogs take turns at eating in hierarchical order. The leader will defend his possessions&#x2014;his living quarters, food, and mate&#x2014;at all costs. The chain of command will change, of course, over the years. Young adults, always on the alert for weaknesses in others, may try to defy more dominant older dogs, and rise to a higher position in the hierarchy if they are victorious. Younger and stronger dogs eventually assume authority in this manner as the dominant animals grow older and less healthy and vigorous. Dogs always inherit these pack tendencies, whether they are wild or domesticated.<br> &nbsp;<br> The same pack behavior patterns govern a dog&#x2019;s relationships with humans. Once a dog enters a new home, you can simply interchange the word &#x201c;pack&#x201d; with the term &#x201c;family.&#x201d; All the members of the household are part of the pack in the dog&#x2019;s eyes. It is extremely important, therefore, that your dog learn his position in the family hierarchy immediately to ensure a well-trained and dependable pet.<br> &nbsp;<br> A dominant-subordinate relationship is imperative in all types of dog training, especially housebreaking. As soon as you get the new puppy or adult dog, you or some other member of your family must assume the role of pack leader&#x2014;with the dog as subordinate&#x2014;by establishing the rules and enforcing them fairly. You must maintain a firm but loving attitude, and once you have assumed the role of leader, you must always play it. If no family member takes the controlling position, the dog will dominate, and you will end up with a spoiled beast that will be difficult, if not impossible, to housetrain. A dog in a new home will test you and other family members until he finds his place. Unless you understand that this initial testing is a way of determining how far he can go, the animal will develop behavior problems. And the problems of an undisciplined dog only get worse as he matures.<br> &nbsp;<br> THE SECRET OF<br> SUCCESSFUL HOUSEBREAKING<br> &nbsp;<br> You have learned that dogs are easy animals to train because they are pack animals with strong tendencies to follow a leader. The secret of successful and rapid housebreaking is to understand that dogs are also den dwellers in their natural state. In the wild, dogs hunt for food, mate, socialize with fellow pack members, and relieve themselves outside their dens. But they always return to their dens, snug and sheltered nests where they feel comfortable and secure, to sleep. Den dwellers will never soil their nests, and this is the prime reason that dogs can be housetrained so easily.<br> &nbsp;<br> Teaching a normal healthy puppy, or even an adult dog, to eliminate in a particular spot is a lot easier than you might imagine, because dogs are naturally clean from birth. For the first three weeks of life, the reflexes and behavioral responses of newborn puppies are directed totally to their mother. They can&#x2019;t see or hear until the fourteenth day, but they can crawl and suckle. Mother feeds the puppies, keeps them warm in her nest, cleans them, and controls their elimination. After feeding, she stimulates excretion by licking each puppy&#x2019;s genitals and anus. Puppies form their first social bonds with their mother and, like human babies, they respond to her affection and attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> Between the ages of four and five weeks, when the puppies attain their sensory and motor abilities, their mother gives them less intensive care, and they become independent enough to toddle in and out of their nest. Social bonds among brothers and sisters begin to develop. The puppies become curious and begin to explore and play together in a lively manner. They also start to bite and fight among themselves as each puppy tries to prevail over the others. In this manner, the puppies begin to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of their littermates and take the first steps to determine dominance and submission.<br> &nbsp;<br> Puppies first become fastidious at about five weeks of age. They can defecate and urinate now without stimulation, and, from this moment, they start going to a particular spot away from their nest to relieve themselves. If a puppy&#x2019;s owner takes advantage of this natural instinct, housebreaking can be accomplished in days, instead of weeks or months.<br> &nbsp;<br> You must also become familiar with your dog&#x2019;s natural excretory instincts. Dogs, like people, usually want to urinate and sometimes to defecate when they wake up. Most dogs, though, tend to have bowel movements about 20 to 30 minutes after eating. It&#x2019;s not hard to determine when your dog should go out, or be placed on his paper, once you understand these basic rhythms.<br> &nbsp;<br> WHEN IS MY DOG<br> READY TO BE HOUSEBROKEN?<br> &nbsp;<br> Behaviorists have determined that the basis of dog training is a bond of attachment or respect formed between animals and human beings. They say the bond is best established when a puppy is between six and eight weeks of age because the early formation of a strong social bond makes a dog more eager to please his master and more attentive during training.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most animal behaviorists recommend separating a puppy from his mother and littermates at about seven to eight weeks of age and placing him in a home with loving people. The puppy will be more inclined to become a member of the family pack at this age; he will become more attached to his owner and be more trainable. If you obtained your puppy from a reliable breeder, the puppy&#x2019;s socialization should have been carefully orchestrated. The puppy will have had social periods with his mother and brothers and sisters, and he will also have received plenty of handling and cuddling by human beings, giving you a well-adjusted animal that will adapt easily to your lifestyle.<br> &nbsp;<br> A puppy&#x2019;s infancy is very short compared to a human baby&#x2019;s: three to four canine months are roughly equal to three to four human years. While there is no magic age for a child to start using the potty or toilet&#x2014;some toddlers begin around the age of two, while others aren&#x2019;t ready until they&#x2019;re older&#x2014;generally the average child is successfully toilet trained by four years old. Correspondingly, the average puppy should be housebroken by four months of age. Please bear in mind the word &#x201c;average.&#x201d; Just as every child is different, every puppy is different. If your puppy isn&#x2019;t housebroken by four months of age, take your time. Don&#x2019;t press him too hard. Stick to the program. Even though housebreaking may take a little longer, at least the puppy will begin to comprehend the principles of it all.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Ebelskivers: Danish-Style Filled Pancakes and other Sweet and Savory Treats</h2><p>Book annotation not available for this title.Title: EbelskiversAuthor: Crafts, Kevin/ Kunkel, Erin (PHT)Publisher: Simon &amp; SchusterPublication Date: 2011/03/01Number of Pages: 111Binding Type: PAPERBACKLibrary of Congress:</p><p>Kevin Crafts is a food stylist and cookbook author whose work has appeared in dozens of media outlets, including <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, <i>InStyle</i>, and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>.

He is the author of ten novels, three works of nonfiction, and four collections of stories.<b>Small Streams in Michigan</b><br><br>The first fly rod I ever owned was eight feet of carpet beater made by a company whose cork grips were supplied by my father. My father worked for a Portuguese cork company whose owners swam at Estoril and supplied our family with innumerable objects of cork, including cork shoes, cork boxes, cork purses, and unidentified flying cork objects that my brother and I threw at each other. In our living room we had large cut-glass decanters of Burgundy, long soured, and my brother and I would have a couple of hits of that vinegar and head for the cellar to throw cork.<br><br>Everyone in our family had a huge brown fly rod with a Portuguese cork handle and identical Pflueger Medalist reels of the size used for Atlantic salmon. As I look back, I am touched by my father's attempts to bring us to sport, en famille.<br><br>I remember when he and my mother canoed the Pere Marquette in that early phase. Passing underneath the branches of streamside trees, my mother seized one of them in terror. The branch flexed; the canoe turned sideways in the current and began to go under. My father bellowed to let go of the branch. My mother did and the branch shot across the canoe like a longbow, taking my father across the chest and knocking him overboard.<br><br>With his weight gone, one end of the canoe rose four feet out of the water and my mother twirled downstream until my father contrived to race along a footpath and make the rescue.<br><br>When it was done, two rods with Portuguese cork grips were gone. The canoe was saved until the time my brother and I used it as a toboggan in snow-filled streambeds and beat the bottom out of it.<br><br>At that time, we lived down on Lake Erie, where I conducted a mixed-bag sporting life, catching perch and rock bass on worms, some pike on Daredevils, some bass on a silver spoon. In the winter, I wandered around the lake on the ice and shot crows, a painful memory.<br><br>But when we went up north with our Portuguese cork handle fly rods, I knew the trout were there. And so I spurned worms, owned a fly box, and espoused purist attitudes in the traditional burst of posturing common to new fly fishers.<br><br>There was a lake near the cabin, and I would paddle out upon it trailing all my fly line and a Mickey Finn streamer. Then I would paddle around the lake, trolling that fly until I caught a trout. This is about the minimum, fly-wise. But I do remember, with a certain finality, what those trout looked like lying between the canoe's varnished ribs, and how it felt to put the trout and jackknife on the dock in the evening, pull the canoe up on the beach, and clean my catch.<br><br>I don't doubt that for many fine anglers the picture of what fishing could be begins with a vision of worm gobs lying in dark underwater holes, the perfect booby trap. The casters I used to see, throwing surface plugs in flat arcs up under the brushy banks, made that kind of fishing seem a myth. And once I could even see the point of fishing with outriggers. But now trout seem to be everything that is smart and perfect in fish, and their taking of a floating fly or free-drifting nymph is a culmination in sport comparable to anything. But what interests me is how I came to believe that.<br><br>I recall grouse hunting near the Pere Marquette when I was very young. It had just snowed, and I had killed one bird, which bulged warm in the back of my coat. I kicked out a few more birds in a forgotten orchard and couldn't get a shot, then walked down a wooded hill that ended in a very small stream, perhaps two feet wide, but cut rather deeply in mossy ground. A short distance above where I stood, the stream made a pool, clear and round as a lens. In the middle of that pool a nice brook trout held in the cold current. With a precision that still impresses me, it moved from one side to the other to intercept nymphs, always perfectly returning to its holding position in the little pool.<br><br>Not long after that, during trout season, I waded the Pere Marquette one hot day on which not a single rising fish was to be found. I plodded along, flicking wan, pointless casts along the bank.<br><br>The river at one point broke into channels, and one channel bulged up against a logjam, producing a kind of pool. I had always approached this place with care because trout soared around its upper parts and if a cast could be placed very quietly on the slick bulge of water, a take was often the result. I crept up, but no trout grazed under its surface waiting for my Lady Beaverkill to parachute in.<br><br>Salvation, though, was around the corner. The deep, shadowy color of the pool seemed to hold a new glint. I stood erect. There was nothing near the top of the pool for me to spook, but clearly trout were deep within it, moving enough to send up their glints.<br><br>I remembered the brooky in the minute fissure of stream when I'd been grouse shooting, and I recalled how steadily he had held except to intercept a free-swimming nymph in the icy water. It occurred to me that something like that sudden lateral movement and return must be what was sending these messages to me from this large pool in the Pere Marquette.<br><br>I tied on an indeterminately colored nymph and shot a cast up to the head of the pool. The nymph dropped and sank, and the point of my floating line began its retreat back toward me at current speed. About a third of the way back, the line point stopped. I lifted and felt the weight. A couple of minutes later, I trapped a nice brown trout against the gravel at the foot of the pool with my trembling hands.<br><br>This was before I had learned the thrill of the release, of a trout darting from your opening hands or resting its weight very slightly in your palms underwater, then easing off. So three nice trout went from the pool into my creel and then, after a decent interval, into my mouth.<br><br>Anyway, the connection was complete. And even if I couldn't always put it together, I saw how it was with nymphs. Years of casting and retrieving made it difficult to slackline a tumbling nymph -- the forms of manipulation in trout fishing are always so remote -- but I realized that fishing a nymph invisible under the pools and runs on a tensionless line was not inferior in magic to fishing a dry-fly.<br><br>Later we found a long beaver pond covering many acres of ground in a dense mixed forest of pine and conifer. I had a hunch that good-sized brook trout had migrated down from the stream and into the pond.<br><br>Beaver ponds are a mixed blessing, providing only a few years of good fishing. After that the standing water turns sour and the size of the average fish gets smaller as his head grows proportionately larger. But this pond was only a couple of years old, with a soft bottom covered with drowned leaves.<br><br>I had some trouble locating the pond but ended up tracking its source through the cedars. It was almost evening when I got there, and huge columns of light came down through the forest. There was a good hatch of mayflies in progress along the stream, with small trout rising to them and cedar waxwings overhead hovering in the swarm.<br><br>The pond was perfect. Some dead trees stood ghostlike in its middle, and the pond itself inundated small bays around the water-tolerant cedars. Best of all, big, easy rises were in numerous places, slow takes that produced an actual sucking noise.<br><br>I cautiously waded for position. The pond was so smooth that I anxiously anticipated the fall of line on its surface. I had a piece of inner tube in my shirt and I used it to thoroughly straighten my leader.<br><br>Every time I moved on the soft bottom, a huge cloud of mud arose, carried behind me and then filtered down through the beaver dam. It was a cool summer evening and I was wearing a flannel shirt; I shivered a little and tried to keep from looking up when one of the big rises opened on the pond.<br><br>I tied on my favorite fly, the Adams, a pattern that exemplifies my indecisive nature. The Adams looks a little like all bugs. It's gray and speckly and a great salesman. My fly box is mainly Adamses in about eight different sizes. In the future, I mean to be a fine streamside entomologist. I'm going to start on that when I am much too old to do any of the two thousand things I can think of that are more fun than screening insects in cold running water.<br><br>Making a first cast on delicate water can be a problem. You haven't warmed up and it may be your most important cast. I had the advantage on this glassy pond of being able to see a number of widely separated rises, and I felt that, at worst, I could blow off one fish and still keep my act alive for one or two more.<br><br>I looked around, trying to find a place for my backcast, stripped some line, and false-cast carefully until the instant a rise began to open on the surface. I threw and dropped the fly much closer than I deserved. I poised myself not to break the light tippet on the strike and held that attitude up to the descending moment I realized the fish wasn't going to take. Another fish rose and I covered him, waited, and got no take.<br><br>I let the line lie on the water and tried to calm down. My loop was turning over clean and quiet; the leader was popping out straight. The Adams sat cheerily on its good hackle points. I refused to believe the fish were that selective. Then I hung up a cast behind me, trying to cover a fish at too new an angle, and a lull set in.<br><br>You never know about lulls. You ask, Is it my fault? Do the trout know I'm here? Have they heard or felt my size-twelve tread on this boggy ground? Is my casting coarse and inaccurate? Where can I buy a drink at this hour?<br><br>It was getting dark. I didn't have a fish. The rises kept appearing. I kept casting and never got a take. There is a metallic loss of light one feels when it is all over. You press to the end but it's kaput. I left in blackness. A warm wind came up and gave the mosquitoes new hope. I lit a cigar to keep them out of my face and trudged through the forms of the big cedars along the stream, trying not to fall. I snagged my suspenders on a bramble and snapped myself. The moon was full and I was thinking about the TV.<br><br>The next evening I was back earlier. This time I crawled to the edge of the pond with the light at my back and had a good look. The first thing I saw was the rises, as many as the night before. I remembered how they had failed to materialize then and checked my excitement. As I watched, I caught a rise at the moment it opened, then saw the fish drop beneath the ring and continue cruising until it was beyond my view. The next rise I caught, I saw another cruiser, moving immediately away from the place of the rise and looking for another insect. I began to realize my error of the night before. These were cruising fish, waiting for something to pass through their observation lane. There were a good number of them traveling about the pond, hunting for food.<br><br>I retreated from my place beside the pond, circled around below the dam and waded into my position of the night before. I tied on another Adams, this time a rather large one. I cast it straight out into the middle of the pond and let it lie.<br><br>Rises continued to happen, picking up a little as evening advanced and the cedar waxwings returned to wait, like me, for the hatch. My Adams floated in place, clearly visible, and I could see the curves of my leader in the surface skin of the water. I waited for a trying length of time. I had to see my theory through because, like many a simpleminded sportsman, I see myself as a problem solver.<br><br>The fly dropped out of sight. I didn't respond until the ring had already started to spread, and I lifted the rod and felt the fish. The trout darted off in a half-dozen chugging didoes in the dark water over drowned leaves. I landed him a moment later, a brook trout of a solid pound. I studied him a moment and thought what a bright, lissome, perfect fish this little American char is.<br><br>Brook trout are cheerfully colored in deep reds, grays, and blues, with ivory leading edges and deep moony spots on their fins. They are called squaretails elsewhere, after the clear graphics of their profiles. I reached for my Adams and felt the small teeth roughen the first knuckles of my thumb and forefinger. Then I let him go. He sank to the leaves at my feet, thought for a minute, and made off.<br><br>I rinsed the fly carefully. That long float required a well-dried fly. Then I false-cast the fly a moment to dry it, applied some Mucilin dressing, which I kept smeared on the back of my left hand, and cast again. This time I stared at the fly for ten or fifteen minutes, long enough to notice the Adams changing its waterline. But then it sank suddenly and I had another fish.<br><br>Since casting was nearly eliminated from this episode, the fishing did not seem fast. But at the end of a couple of hours, I had taken seven fish. The takers were all solid, confident, and deep. I released all the fish, and by the time I'd hiked out of the boggy forest that night, I could feel glory all around me.<br><br>One might say, pragmatically, that in still or nearly still waters, feeding trout cruise; and that in streams and rivers they tend to take a feeding lane and watch a panel of moving water overhead, elevating to eat when something passes; and that the repeated rises of a holding trout in a stream are as unlike the disparate rises of my beaver pond as they are unlike the deep glintings of nymphing trout. But the fact is, these episodes are remembered as complete dramatic entities, whose real function, finally, is to be savored. It is fine, of course, to escalate them toward further successes. But in the end, angling has nothing whatsoever to do with success.<br><br>Nevertheless, by the time the aforementioned nymphing trout had been met and dealt with, I had come to think of myself as a pretty smart fisherman. I had a six-cylinder black Ford, a mahogany tackle box, two split-cane rods, and Adamses in eight sizes. I had cheap, clean lodgings within quick reach of the Pigeon, Black, and Sturgeon rivers, where I ate decently prepared food with the owner, one or two other fishermen, and perhaps a young salesman with a line of practical shoes and a Ford like mine.<br><br>From here, I'd pick a stretch of the Pigeon or the Black for the early fishing, wade the oxbow between the railroad bridges on the Sturgeon in the afternoon. Then, in the evening, I'd head for a wooden bridge over the Sturgeon near Wolverine.<br><br>Below the bridge was a large pool deeply surrounded by brush and inhabited by nearly nocturnal brown trout. A sandy bottom shelved off into the undercut banks and it was a rarity to find a feeding fish here in the daytime. But shortly after dinnertime in the summer, when the hatches seemed to come, the trout would venture out into the open pool and feed with greater boldness.<br><br>I stood on the bridge and rigged my rod with a relatively short, heavy leader. The fish were not leader-shy this late. I tied on a fly known locally as a "caddis," though it was anything but an actual caddis. This was a huge, four-winged fly with a crosshatched deerhair body. Lying in your open hand, it covered the palm, and when cast, its wings made a turbulent noise like the sound of a bat passing your ear.<br><br>The trout liked it real well. What I appreciated was that I could fish from this wooden bridge in the black of night without fear of falling in a hole, filling my waders, and passing on. I'd cast that big baby until two or three in the morning, guessing at the rate at which I should retrieve to keep up with the fly backing down on the current toward me. I had to strike by sound every rise I heard. Five out of six rises I struck would just snatch the fly and line into a heap at my feet. But that one out of six would ...</p><h2>Adelita</h2><p><i>Hace mucho tiempo</i>&#x2014;a long time ago&#x2014;there lived a beautiful young woman named Adelita.

He was also the 1990 United States nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, and received the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for lifetime contribution to children's literature in 2011.</p> <p>DePaola has published almost 200 children's books in&nbsp;15 different countries over the past 30 years.&nbsp;Among his most well-known titles are the <i>Strega Nona </i>series, <i>26 Fairmount Avenue</i>, and <i>The Legend of the Indian Paintbrush.</i></p> <p>DePaola lives in an interesting house in New Hampshire with his four dogs. His studio is in a large renovated 200-year-old barn.</p>Kindergarten-Grade 3-In this folktale variant, lovely Adelita gains a family when her father remarries. Following the traditional story line, Dona Micaela and her daughters, Valentina and Dulce, are utterly impossible, but all is well as long as Adelita's father is alive. However, when he dies, she is relegated to helping in the kitchen. Eventually, Dona Micaela evicts old Esperanza, and her stepdaughter is left to do all the work. On the night of the fiesta at the Gordillos' hacienda, it is Esperanza who takes the fairy godmother role, sends Adelita to the party, and sees to it that young Javier is smitten. True to form, he locates the young woman when she flees, and they marry. The prose is straightforward and crisp, though the habit of including a Spanish phrase that is translated immediately afterward (e.g., "Soy yo-only me-" or "-mi peque-ita-my little one-") interrupts the narrative flow. However, this is a minor quibble given the beauty of dePaola's signature artwork. Making perfect use of clear, warm hues, the full-color acrylic illustrations are a feast for the eye. Depth and brilliance in composition combine with economy of line and form to create a true tour de force. Use this with either Robert D. San Souci's Little Gold Star (HarperCollins, 2000) or Joe Hayes's Little Gold Star/Estrellita de oro (Cinco Puntos, 2000) for different looks at "Cinderella" through Mexican eyes.<br><i>Ann Welton, Grant Elementary School, Tacoma, WA</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears and the Slumber Party</h2><p><b>This classic Berenstain Bears story is a perfect way to teach children about personal responsibility and <b>privileges</b>!</b><br><br>Come for a visit in Bear Country with this classic First Time Book� from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

I started drawing as far back as I can remember, at the age of four or five. My brothers drew, and I guess in a way I was mimicking them. I found I enjoyed the act of putting marks on paper. It gave me a way of creating my own space and quiet time, as well as a way of expressing myself. You can imagine six children competing for attention and to be heard. I would sit, watching and drawing.</p><p>"In first grade I had the opportunity to draw a large picture of a fire engine on the blackboard. I was complimented and encouraged to draw more. The attention felt good, and I wanted more. I was not a terrific reader or adept speller in my growing-up years, and I felt insecure in those areas. Drawing helped me build my self-esteem and feel good about myself, and, with hard work, I graduated from elementary school with honors.</p><p>"I attended an all-black elementary school, and I gained a strong sense of self and an appreciation of my own culture there. But Roosevelt Junior High was integrated. There I had many friends, both white and black, at a time when there was little mixing socially in school. There the spark for my curiosity about people was lit. You can see this interest and fascination with people of different cultures throughout my work.</p><p>"My formal art training started at Dobbins Vocational High School, and upon graduation I received a scholarship to the Philadelphia Museum College of Art. My major was advertising and design. The most exciting classes for me were drawing, painting, and printmaking. It is no wonder I turned to illustrating and designing books. For me the book represents the ultimate in graphics: first, as a designer, considering space, page size, number of pages, and type size; then, as an illustrator, dealing with the aesthetics of line, color, and form.</p><p>"There were three books that somehow magically came into my possession in the early sixties: <em>The Wind in the Willows</em>, illustrated by Arthur Rackham; <em>The Wonder Clock</em>, illustrated by Howard Pyle; and <em>Rain Makes Applesauce</em>, illustrated by Marvin Bileck. You can see those influences in my art today. Later, my work was greatly influenced by such African American artists as Charles White, Romare Bearden, and Jacob Lawrence.</p><p>"From the very beginning of my career in illustrating books, research has been important. I do as much as possible on a given subject, so that I live the experience and have a vision of the people and places. To capture a sense of realism for characters in my work, I use models that resemble the people I want to portray. My wife, Gloria Jean (also an author), and I keep a closetful of old clothes to dress up the models, and I have the models act out the story. Photos are taken to aid me in better understanding body language and facial expressions. Once I have that photo in front of me I have freedom, because the more you know, the more you can be inventive.</p><p>"For illustrating stories about animals, I keep a large reference file of over a hundred books on nature and animals. The first step in envisioning a creature is for me to pretend to be that particular animal. I think about its size and the sounds it makes, how it moves (slowly or quickly), and where it lives. I try to capture the feeling of the creature, as well as its true-to-life characteristics. There are times when the stories call for the animals to be anthropomorphic, and I've used photographs of myself posing as the animal characters.</p><p>"It still amazes me how much the projects I have illustrated have given back to me in terms of personal and artistic satisfaction. They have given me the opportunity to use my imagination, to draw, to paint, to travel through the voices of the characters in the stories, and, above all else, to touch children."</p></p><h2>The Berenstain Bears and the Bully</h2><p><b>This beloved story is a perfect way to teach children about bullies, problem-solving, and communication!</b><br><br>Come for a visit in Bear Country with this timeless&nbsp;classic from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

The first story starring the bear family,&nbsp;<i>The Big Honey Hunt,</i>&nbsp;appeared in 1962. Since then, more than 300 Berenstain Bears books have been published and more than 260 million copies have been sold. What began as an idea sparked by their young sons&#x2019; love of reading has become over the years arguably the best-selling children&#x2019;s book series ever. Since their inception, the Berenstain Bears stories have expanded to include picture books, beginning readers, and chapter books&#x2014;even a hit TV show on PBS. Writing and illustrating the books has become a Berenstain family affair. Mike joined with his parents as a creative team in the late 1980s. The Bear family has expanded over the years as well. Sister Bear arrived in 1974, and baby Honey joined the family in 2000.</p><h2>The Ultimate Sales Letter, 4th Edition: Attract New Customers.

Honors Award As a boy, Jadav Payeng was distressed by the destruction deforestation and erosion was causing on his island home in India&#39;s Brahmaputra River. So he began planting trees. What began as a small thicket of bamboo, grew over the years into 1,300 acre forest filled with native plants and animals. The Boy Who Grew a Forest tells the inspiring true story of Payeng--and reminds us all of the difference a single person with a big idea can make.</p><p>The true story of a young boy who built a forest from the ground up in northeastern India. Inspired by the documentary Forest Man, debut author Gholz pens the story of Jadav Payeng. The story begins with the erosive impact of seasonal floodwaters on his island home, which propels Jadav to take action. A group of elders give him 20 bamboo seedlings to plant. He plants them and waters them every day, devising various methods of irrigation, and over time, his hard work pays off and a forest grows. Animals come back but with them come threats. However, Jadav inventively copes and continues to protect the forest. While the relative absence of the community throughout Jadav's endeavors is somewhat startling, the story provides young children with a real-life example of the connections between man and nature. Gholz refers to Jadav throughout the book only as "the boy" or "the man," which has a distancing effect. The depictions of Jadav himself as a child are similarly generic, whereas those of him as an adult are reasonably accurate to photographs. Moreover, facts indicate that Jadav was 16 when he started planting the trees, but the book shows him as a much younger child. The illustrations overall are detailed and engaging, however, with beautiful imagery of the islands and the forest. Backmatter provides further information, a glossary, and tips on planting. --Kirkus Reviews<br><br><p> If anyone questions how much one person can do, Sophia Gholz puts these doubts to rest in her inspiring biography of a child who recognized a danger to the people and wildlife of his island and solved the problem for generations to come. Kayla Harren's exquisite sundrenched illustrations transport readers to the Indian island to show the effects of eroded shorelines, stranded animals, and the overwhelming task Jadav took on. A gorgeous and beautifully told story about the power of one will excite children to make a difference in their own way. --Celebrate Picture Books </p> The Boy who Grew a Forest: The True Story of Jadav Payeng: This inspiring story has a lesson for us all! Concerned with the loss of trees in on his island, Payeng began planting trees. This small wood grew to be a forest and a home for flora and fauna. --Kita B World <p> Payeng's story is eloquently told and beautifully illustrated. </p> --Booklist<br><br>This inspiring true story shows how one individual no matter how young can make a difference. The book teaches kids about ecology and sustainability while supporting positive life skills such as hard work, persistence, and responsibility. The rich illustrations capture Jadav's environment in detail with emotion and heart. --Bicultural Mama BlogGr 1&#x2013;5&#x2014;"In India, on a large river island, among farms and families hard at work, there lived a boy who loved trees." Prompted by the alarming death of hundreds of snakes stranded on a barren sandbar when he was just a boy, Jadav went to the elders of his village. They explained that the floodwaters cause erosion, which gradually shrinks the island, leaving animals homeless and stranded, like the snakes. The village gave young Jadav 20 bamboo saplings to plant. Not only did he plant the trees, he also devised a watering system and created richer soil, eventually planting more than 1,300 acres of trees. Soon, birds, snakes, rhinos, and elephants returned. When tigers appeared, threatening the villagers, Jadav planted more grasses to attract small animals to appease them. When elephants ventured onto village farms to eat their crops, he planted fruit trees to satisfy them. His understanding of ecology and human responsibility make him a hero. His decision to make a difference as a child will empower young readers. An author's note, glossary, and instructions on planting are included. Lush, realistic illustrations document young Jadav's sadness, fear, determination, and eventual success as readers watch the barren, disintegrating island transform into a living forest supporting all manners of life.

Which is to say, he discovers the lunchroom run by the esteemed Roz, a fine cook who isn't above rewarding a bug who can say her name with a delicious cup of chicken bones and fish heads in sour milk. But when Roz is fired in favor of Miss Muzzle&#x2014;whose idea of a nourishing lunch is burnt peas and turnips&#x2014;it's up to the resourceful Fly Guy to return the favor. Arnold's pop-eyed, big-headed cartoon figures provide the proper comedic air for this brief episode, which is arranged in chapters and wrapped in an eye-catching, glittery cover.

Fly Guy loves the dirty dishes, the smelly mop, and the garbage cans. When he meets Roz, the lunch lady, she pronounces, &#x201c;No flies in the lunchroom!&#x201d; Then Fly Guy endears himself to her by saying her name, &#x201c;Rozzz,&#x201d; and she feeds him treats (fish heads in sour milk). Sadly, Roz is fired after her boss demands that the lunchroom be fly-free. She is replaced by Miss Muzzle, who makes burnt peas and turnips. Everyone misses Roz, and Buzz makes a plan. After Fly Guy boinks Miss Muzzle on the nose, she tries to swat him and makes such a mess that she is fired, and Roz returns the next day. Arnold's golf ball&#x2013;eyed kids and fly are amusingly and comically exaggerated. Together with the zippy metallic cover and short, simple text, which is divided into three short chapters, they add up to a fly-by delight. &#x2013;Julie Cummins<br>Tedd Arnold Super Fly Guy; illus. by the author<br>32 pp. Cartwheel/Scholastic 3/06 ISBN 0-439-63904-2 $5.99<br>(Preschool, Primary)<br>How's this for a backstory? "A boy had a pet fly. The fly was named Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say the boy's name -- Buzz!" And, with that, Arnold zooms right into this sequel to the 2006 Geisel Honor Book Hi! Fly Guy. This time, Fly Guy and Buzz go to school, where Fly Guy shows off more of his genius by not only learning phonics (does, fuzz, and was) but also moving right up to the application level when he goes to the lunchroom and addresses Roz, the cook. Roz's small act of kindness (she lets Fly Guy eat chicken bones and fish heads in sour milk) is unrewarded when she's fired. But Fly Guy, with Buzz's help, gets his revenge (and more practice in phonics) by outwitting her replacement, Miss Muzzle, known in flyspeak as "Mizz Muzz." The cartoon illustrations of Fly Guy, with his, well, bug eyes, are a welcome departure from the sweet and fuzzy animals that populate so many beginning readers, and this manic story, told in three chapters with simple vocabulary and repetitive phrases, creates an energy for reading. Expect a lot of buzz over this one.

Various bear families are seen bustling about Kozikowski's cozy cottages in preparation for the outing. After trekking across an inviting, patchwork-quilt landscape, the hungry bruins arrive at a pine-framed glade and spread out a lavish repast. Badminton and butterfly catching are among the day's pursuits, until "at six o'clock their mommies and daddies will take them home to bed." Providing extra fun are the alternating cut-out half pages, as children can truly view "both sides of the situation." Though the artist's sparkling colors and intricate details create an amiable impression overall, the book doesn't quite measure up to its beguiling source--a certain flatness creeps in, owing perhaps to a lack of characterization in the leading players.

But you won&#x2019;t know all about me, so that is why there is now this second book.<br><br>In case you missed it, my name is Alvin Ho. I was born scared and I am still scared. Things that scare me include:<br><br>Long words (especially &#x201c;hippopotomonstro- sesquipedaliophobia,&#x201d; which means fear of long words).<br><br>Punctuation. (Except for exclamation points! Exclamations are fantastic!!!)<br><br>The dark (which means I have nyctophobia).<br><br>The great outdoors. (What&#x2019;s so great about it?) Lots of things can happen when you&#x2019;re outdoors:<br><br>Hurricanes.<br><br>Tornadoes.<br><br>Mudslides.<br><br>Landslides.<br><br>The end of the world.<br><br>I am scared of many more things than that. But if I put all my scares on one list, it would mean years of therapy for me. And I already go to therapy once a month on account of it&#x2019;s supposed to help me not be so scared. But my brother Calvin says when you&#x2019;re born a certain way, that&#x2019;s the way you&#x2019;ll always be, so you might as well hug your inner scaredy-cat.<br><br>My brother Calvin, he gives good advice.<br><br>I am not so good with advice. I can never think of any, except maybe this: When in doubt, always ask, &#x201c;What would Henry do?&#x201d; Henry is Henry David Thoreau. He&#x2019;s a dead author, which is really creepy. But he is also our school hero, which is not so creepy, and he was a lot like me&#x2014;he had stuff figured out, even when he was little. He was born in Concord, Massachusetts, just like me. And&#x2014;gulp&#x2014;he died in Concord too.<br><br>Of course, I could never say, &#x201c;What would Henry do?&#x201d; at school, where I never say anything. This is on account of school is mortifying. And when I am mortified, which means totally scared to death, I can&#x2019;t scream, I can&#x2019;t talk, I can&#x2019;t even grunt. Nothing comes out of my mouth, no matter how hard I try.<br><br>Having a lot in common with Henry can be very useful. For example, we learned in music class today that Henry played the flute. And whenever he played, a mouse would come to listen, and Henry would feed it with the extra pieces of cheese that he kept in his pocket.<br><br>&#x201c;My brother has a flute,&#x201d; I told the gang on the bus after school. &#x201c;He rented it for lessons . . . and we have cheese in the refrigerator.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go,&#x201d; said Pinky.<br><br>So when the bus stopped at the end of my driveway, the gang followed me to my house. Usually, it is a tricky business getting them to play with me unless it is Pinky&#x2019;s idea. Pinky is the biggest boy and the leader of the gang, and no one plays with me unless Pinky does.<br><br>Except for Flea. Flea plays with me no matter what. But the problem with Flea is that she&#x2019;s a girl. And girls are annoying.<br><br>Fortunately, my mom was at work and my gunggung, who comes to watch us after school, was fast asleep on the sofa. So I left the gang in the kitchen and tiptoed past the sofa . . . to fetch Calvin&#x2019;s flute from the top of the piano where he had put it for safekeeping. No problem.<br><br>The only problem was Anibelly. She&#x2019;s four, she&#x2019;s my sister, and she was wide awake, following me everywhere and getting in my way as usual.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s Calvin&#x2019;s,&#x201d; said Anibelly.<br><br>I stopped. I pretended I didn&#x2019;t see Anibelly. But it is hard not to see her. She&#x2019;s like a stoplight in the middle of my life and there&#x2019;s just no avoiding her. I can&#x2019;t go anywhere without going past her or taking her with me if I&#x2019;m in a hurry.<br><br>&#x201c;But Calvin&#x2019;s practicing his karate moves at Stevie&#x2019;s house,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I need his flute for a little experiment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What spearmint?&#x201d; asked Anibelly.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you live in Concord, Massachusetts, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>Anibelly nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;You believe in Henry David Thoreau, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>Anibelly nodded again.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, then, if you keep quiet,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let you watch.&#x201d;<br><br>So Anibelly kept quiet.<br><br>First I put Calvin&#x2019;s flute together.<br><br>Then I went back into the kitchen where the gang was waiting and looked for some cheese.<br><br>Actually there was quite a lot of cheese, all chopped up and zipped inside a plastic bag. It was very yummy. And we were hungrier than a pack of starving mice. By the time we finished snacking, there were only a few crumbs left to put in my pocket. But I was sure that our teacher, Miss P, had said that Henry had pieces of cheese, not crumbs.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d heard pieces too, not crumbs,&#x201d; said Sam, who usually always pays better attention in class than I do. &#x201c;A mouse isn&#x2019;t going to come for crumbs.&#x201d;<br><br>So we cobbled all our crumbs together to make a piece of cheese, which I put in my pocket. Then I picked up Calvin&#x2019;s flute, put it to my lips and blew.<br><br>&#x201c;Pshhhhhffffffffrrrrrrrrrrr.&#x201d; It sounded like a sick worm blowing its nose. So I blew again, harder. &#x201c;Pshhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lemme try,&#x201d; said Pinky, snatching the flute and the piece of cobbled cheese from my pocket. &#x201c;Pssssssssuuurrrgggggh!&#x201d; He sounded worse than I did!<br><br>Then Nhia took a turn. Then Sam. Then Jules and Eli and Hobson. By the time Calvin&#x2019;s flute was finally passed to Flea, it was drooling worse than our dog, Lucy, on a hot day, and the cobbled cheese that ended up in her pocket was hardly recognizable as cheese, except for the smell.</p><h2>The Berenstain Bears and the Homework Hassle</h2><p><b>This classic Berenstain Bears story is a perfect way to teach children about personal responsibility and the importance of school!<br></b><br>Come for a visit in Bear Country with this classic First Time Book� from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

Thorp invented card counting, proving the seemingly impossible: that you could beat the dealer at the blackjack table. As a result he launched a gambling renaissance. His remarkable success&#x2014;and mathematically unassailable method&#x2014;caused such an uproar that casinos altered the rules of the game to thwart him and the legions he inspired. They barred him from their premises, even put his life in jeopardy. Nonetheless, gambling was forever changed.<br><br> Thereafter, Thorp shifted his sights to &#x201c;the biggest casino in the world&#x201d;: Wall Street. Devising and then deploying mathematical formulas to beat the market, Thorp ushered in the era of quantitative finance we live in today. Along the way, the so-called godfather of the quants played bridge with Warren Buffett, crossed swords with a young Rudy Giuliani, detected the Bernie Madoff scheme, and, to beat the game of roulette, invented, with Claude Shannon, the world&#x2019;s first wearable computer.<br><br> Here, for the first time, Thorp tells the story of what he did, how he did it, his passions and motivations, and the curiosity that has always driven him to disregard conventional wisdom and devise game-changing solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. An intellectual thrill ride, replete with practical wisdom that can guide us all in uncertain financial waters, <i>A Man for All Markets</i> is an instant classic&#x2014;a book that challenges its readers to think logically about a seemingly irrational world.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>A Man for All Markets</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;In <i>A Man for All Markets</i>, [Thorp] delightfully recounts his progress (if that is the word) from college teacher to gambler to hedge-fund manager. Along the way we learn important lessons about the functioning of markets and the logic of investment.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;[Thorp] gives a biological summation (think Richard Feynman&#x2019;s <i>Surely You&#x2019;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i>) of his quest to prove the aphorism &#x2018;the house always wins&#x2019; is flawed. . . . Illuminating for the mathematically inclined, and cautionary for would-be gamblers and day traders&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><br> <b><i>Library Journal</i></b></p><p><b>Edward O. Thorp</b> is the author of the bestseller <i>Beat the Dealer</i>, which transformed the game of blackjack. His subsequent book, <i>Beat the Market,</i> co-authored with Sheen T. Kassouf, influenced securities markets around the globe. Thorp is one of the world&#x2019;s best blackjack players and<i> </i>investors, and his hedge funds were profitable every year for twenty-nine years. He lives in Newport Beach, California.Chapter 1<br><br>Loving to Learn<br><br>My first memory is of standing with my parents on an outdoor landing at the top of some worn and dirty wooden steps. It was a gloomy Chicago day in December 1934, when I was two years and four months old. Even wearing my only set of winter pants and a jacket with a hood, it was cold. Black and leafless, the trees stood out above the snow-covered ground. From inside the house a woman was telling my parents, &#x201c;No, we don&#x2019;t rent to people with children.&#x201d; Their faces fell and they turned away. Had I done something wrong? Why was I a problem? This image from the depths of the Great Depression has stayed with me always.<br><br>I next recall being taken at age two and a half to our beloved family physician, Dr. Dailey. My alarmed parents explained that I had yet to speak a single word. What was wrong? The doctor smiled and asked me to point to the ball on his desk. I did so, and he asked me to pick up his pencil. After I had done this and a few more tasks he said, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, he&#x2019;ll talk when he&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d; We left, my parents relieved and a little mystified.<br><br>After this, the campaign to get me to talk intensified. About the time of my third birthday, my mother and two of her friends, Charlotte and Estelle, took me along with them to Chicago&#x2019;s then famous Montgomery Ward department store. As we sat on a bench near an elevator, two women and a man got off. Charlotte, keen to tempt me into speech, asked, &#x201c;Where are the people going?&#x201d; I said clearly and distinctly, &#x201c;The man is going to buy something and the two women are going to the bathroom to do pee-pee.&#x201d; Charlotte and Estelle both blushed deeply at the mention of pee-pee. Far too young to have learned conventional embarrassment, I noticed this but didn&#x2019;t understand why they reacted that way. I also was puzzled by the sensation I had caused with my sudden change from silence to talkativeness.<br><br>From then on I spoke largely in complete sentences, delighting my parents and their friends, who now plied me with questions and often received surprising answers. My father set out to see what I could learn.<br><br>Born in Iowa in 1898, my father, Oakley Glenn Thorp, was the second of three children, with his brother two years older and sister two years younger. When he was six his family broke up. His father took him and his brother to settle in the state of Washington. His mother and sister remained in Iowa. In 1915 my grandfather died from the flu, three years before the Great Flu Pandemic of 1918&#x2013;19, which killed between twenty and forty million people worldwide. The two boys lived with an uncle until 1917. Then my father, at age eighteen, went to France to join World War I as part of the great American Expeditionary Force. He fought with the infantry in the trenches, rose from private to sergeant, and was awarded the Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and two Purple Hearts for heroism in places like Ch�teau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and the Battles of the Marne. As a very small boy I remember sitting in his lap on a humid afternoon examining the shrapnel scars on his chest and the minor mutilation of some of his fingers.<br><br>Following his discharge from the army after the war, my father enrolled at Oklahoma A&amp;M. He completed a year and a half before he had to leave for lack of funds, but his hunger and respect for education endured and he instilled them in me, along with his unspoken hope that I would achieve more. Sensing this and hoping it would bring us closer, I welcomed his efforts to teach me.<br><br>As soon as I began to talk, he introduced me to numbers. I found it easy to count first to a hundred, then to a thousand. Next I learned how to increase any number by adding one to get the next number, which meant I could count forever if I only knew the names of the numbers. I soon learned how to count to a million. Adults seemed to think this was a very big number so I sat down to do it one morning. I knew I could eventually get there but I had no idea how long it was going to take. To get started, I chose a Sears catalog the size of a big-city telephone book because it seemed to have the most things to count. The pages were filled with pictures of merchandise labeled with the letters A, B, C . . . , which I recall appeared as black letters in white circles. I started at the beginning of the catalog and counted all the circled letters, one for each item, page after page. After a few hours I fell asleep at something like 32,576. My mother reported that when I awoke I resumed with &#x201c;32,577 . . .&#x201d;<br><br>A trait that showed up at about this time was my tendency not to accept anything I was told until I had checked it for myself. This had consequences. When I was three, my mother told me not to touch the hot stove because it would burn me. I brought my finger close enough to feel the warmth, then pressed the stove with my hand. Burned. Never again.<br><br>Another time, I was warned that fresh eggs would crack if they were squeezed just a little bit. Wondering what &#x201c;a little bit&#x201d; meant, I squeezed an egg very slowly until it cracked, then practiced squeezing another, stopping just before it would crack, to see exactly how far I could go. From the beginning, I loved learning through experimentation and exploration how my world worked.<br><br>After teaching me counting, my father&#x2019;s next project for me was reading. We started with See Spot, See Spot Run, and See Jane. I was puzzled and disoriented for a couple of days; then I saw that the groups of letters stood for the words we spoke. In the next few weeks I went through all of our simple beginner books and developed a small vocabulary. Now it got exciting. I saw printed words everywhere and realized that if I could figure out how to pronounce them I might recognize them and know what they meant. Phonics came naturally, and I learned to sound out words so I could say them aloud. Next was the reverse process&#x2014;hear a word and say the letters&#x2014;spelling. By the time I turned five I was reading at the level of a ten-year-old, gobbling up everything I could find.<br><br>Our family dynamics also changed then, with the birth of my brother. My father, fortunate to be employed in the midst of the Great Depression, worked longer hours to support us. My mother was fully occupied by the new baby and was even more focused on him when, at six months of age, he caught pneumonia and nearly died. This left me much more on my own and I responded by exploring endless worlds, both real and imagined, to be found in the books my father gave me.<br><br>Over the next couple of years I read books including Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels, Treasure Island, and Stanley and Livingstone in Africa. When, after an eight-month arduous and dangerous search, Stanley found his quarry, the only European known to be in Central Africa, I thrilled to his incredible understatement, &#x201c;Dr. Livingstone, I presume,&#x201d; and I discussed the splendor of the Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River with my father, who assured me (correctly) that they far surpassed our own Niagara Falls.<br><br>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels was a special favorite, with its tiny Lilliputians, giant Brobdingnagians, talking horses, and finally the mysterious Laputa, a flying island in the sky supported by magnetic forces. I enjoyed the vivid pictures it created in my mind and the fantastical notions that spurred me to imagine for myself further wonders that might be. But at the time Swift&#x2019;s historical allusions and social satire mostly escaped me, despite explanations by my father.<br><br>From Malory&#x2019;s story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, I learned about heroes and villains, romance, justice, and retribution. I admired the heroes who, through extraordinary abilities and resourcefulness, achieved great things. Introverted and thoughtful, I may have been inspired to mirror this in the future by using my mind to overcome intellectual obstacles, instead of my body to defeat human opponents. The books helped establish lifelong values of fair play, a level playing field for everyone, and treating others as I myself wish to be treated.<br><br>The words and adventures were largely in my head; I didn&#x2019;t really have anyone to discuss them with, except sometimes my tired father after work or on weekends. This led to an occasional unique pronunciation. For instance, for a couple of years I thought misled (miss-LED) was pronounced MYE-zzled, and for years afterward when I saw the word in print I would hesitate for a beat as I mentally corrected my pronunciation.<br><br>When I was reading or just thinking, my concentration was so complete that I lost all awareness of my surroundings. My mother would call me, with no response. Thinking I was willfully ignoring her, the shout would became a yell, then she would bring her flushed face right up to me. Only when she appeared in my visual field did I snap back into the here and now and respond. She had a hard time deciding whether her son was stubborn and badly behaved or was really as unaware as he claimed.<br><br>Though we were poor, my parents valued books and managed to buy me one occasionally. My father made challenging choices. As a result, between the ages of five and seven I carried around adult-looking books and strangers wondered if I actually knew what was in them. One man put me to an unexpected and potentially embarrassing test.<br><br>It happened because my parents became friends with the Kesters, who lived on a farm in Crete, Illinois, about forty-five miles from our home. They invited us out for two weeks every summer, starting in 1937 when I was turning five. These special days were what I most looked forward to each year. For a city boy from the outskirts of Chicago, it was sheer joy to watch &#x201c;water spiders&#x201d; scoot over the surface of a slowly meandering creek, to play hide-and-seek in the fields of tall corn, to catch butterflies and display them arrayed and mounted on boards, and to wander through the fields and among the cottonwood trees and orchards. The Kesters&#x2019; oldest boy, strapping twentysomething Marvin, would carry me around on his shoulders. My mother, along with the women of the household, Marvin&#x2019;s pretty sister Edna Mae, their mother, and their aunt May, would preserve massive quantities of fruits and vegetables. In our basement back home my father built racks for the rubber-sealed mason jars of corn, peaches, and apricots that we brought back. Then there were the rows of fruit jellies, jams, and preserves in glasses sealed with a layer of paraffin on top. This cornucopia would last us well into the next year.<br><br>My father helped Marvin and his father, Old Man Kester, with the work of the farm, and sometimes I tagged along. One sunny forenoon during the second summer of our two weeks in Crete, my father took me to pick up supplies at a local store. I was just turning six, tall and thin with a mop of curly brown hair, lightly tanned, pants too short, the bare ankles ending in a pair of tennis shoes with frayed laces. I was carrying A Child&#x2019;s History of England by Charles Dickens.<br><br>A stranger chatting with my father took the volume I was holding, written at the tenth-grade level, thumbed through it, then told my father, &#x201c;That kid can&#x2019;t read this book.&#x201d; My father replied proudly, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s already read it. Ask him a question and you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br><br>With a smirk the man said, &#x201c;Okay, kid, name all the kings and queens of England in order and tell me the years that they reigned.&#x201d; My father&#x2019;s face fell but to me this seemed to be just another routine request to look into my head to see if the information was there.<br><br>I did and then recited, &#x201c;Alfred the Great, began 871, ended 901, Edward the Elder, began 901, ended 925,&#x201d; and so on. As I finished the list of fifty or so rulers with &#x201c;Victoria, began in 1837 and it doesn&#x2019;t say when she ended,&#x201d; the man&#x2019;s smirk had long vanished. Silently he handed me back the book. My father&#x2019;s eyes were shining.<br><br>My father was a sad and lonely man who didn&#x2019;t express his feelings and who rarely touched us, but I loved him. I felt that this stranger was using me to put him down and I realized that I had stopped it. Whenever I remember my dad&#x2019;s happiness at this, it echoes in me with a force that still seems undiminished.<br><br>My unusual retention of information was pronounced until I was about nine or ten, when it faded into a memory that is very good for what I&#x2019;m interested in and, with exceptions, not especially remarkable for much else. I still remember facts from this time such as my phone number (Lackawanna 1123) and address (3627 North Oriole; 7600 W, 3600 N) in Chicago and Chicago&#x2019;s seven-digit population (3,376,438), cited in the old green 1930 Rand McNally Atlas and Gazetteer that&#x2019;s still on my bookshelf.<br><br>Between the ages of three and five I learned to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers of any size. I also learned the US version of the prefixes million, billion, trillion, and so on, up to decillion. I found that I could add columns of figures quickly by either seeing them or hearing them. One day when I was five or six I was in the neighborhood grocery store with my mother and overheard the owner calling out the prices as he totaled up the customer&#x2019;s bill on his adding machine. When he announced the answer, I said no, and gave him my number. He laughed good-naturedly, added the numbers again, and found I was right. To my delight he rewarded me with an ice-cream cone. After that I dropped by when I could and checked his totals. On the rare occasions when we disagreed, I was usually correct and would get another cone.<br><br>My father taught me to compute the square root of a number. I learned to do it with pencil and paper as well as to work out the answer in my head. Then I learned to do cube roots.<br><br>Before the advent of writing and books, human knowledge was memorized and transmitted down the generations by storytellers; but when this skill wasn&#x2019;t necessary it declined. Similarly, in our time with the ubiquity of computers and hand calculators, the ability to carry out mental calculations has largely disappeared. Yet a person who knows just grammar school arithmetic can learn to do mental calculations comfortably and habitually.<br><br>This skill, especially to make rapid approximate calculations, remains valuable, particularly for assessing the quantitative statements that one continually encounters. For instance, listening to the business news on the way to my office one morning, I heard the reporter say, &#x201c;The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA] is down 9 points to 11,075 on fears of a further interest rate rise to quell an overheated economy.&#x201d; I mentally estimated a typical (one standard deviation ) DJIA change from the previous close, by an hour after the open, at about 0.6 percent or about sixty-six points. The probability of the reported move of &#x201c;at least&#x201d; nine points, or less than a seventh of this, was about 90 percent, so the market action was, contrary to the report, very quiet and hardly indicative of any fearful response to the news. There was nothing to worry about. Simple math allowed me to separate hype from reality.</p><h2>Dragon Ball Z, Vol. 5 (VIZBIG Edition): Dr. Gero&#39;s Laboratory of Terror!</h2><p>R to L (Japanese Style). <b>Change Your Perspective--Get BIG A Collection of Volumes 13 - 15!

There's a logical (Hiaasenian) explanation for that, but not for how and why it parted from its shadowy owner. Yancy thinks the boating-accident/shark-luncheon explanation is full of holes, and if he can prove murder, the sheriff might rescue him from his grisly Health Inspector gig (it's not called the roach patrol for nothing).<br><br> But first-this being Hiaasen country-Yancy must negotiate an obstacle course of wildly unpredictable events with a crew of even more wildly unpredictable characters, including his just-ex lover, a hot-blooded fugitive from Kansas; the twitchy widow of the frozen arm; two avariciously optimistic real-estate speculators; the Bahamian voodoo witch known as the Dragon Queen, whose suitors are blinded unto death by her peculiar charms; Yancy's new true love, a kinky coroner; and the eponymous bad monkey-who just may be one of Carl Hiaasen's greatest characters. <br><br></p><p>Carl Hiaasen was born and raised in Florida. He is the author of nine previous novels. He also writes a twice-weekly metropolitan column for The Miami Herald.<b>One</b><br><br> On the hottest day of July, trolling in dead-calm waters near Key West, a tourist named James Mayberry reeled up a human arm. His wife flew to the bow of the boat and tossed her breakfast burritos.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;re you waiting for?&#x201d; James Mayberry barked at the mate.&#x201c;Get that thing off my line!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The kid tugged and twisted, but the barb of the hook was imbedded in bone. Finally the captain came down from the bridge and used bent-nose pliers to free the decomposing limb, which he placed on shaved ice in a deck box.<br> &nbsp;<br> James Mayberry said, &#x201c;For Christ&#x2019;s sake, now where are we supposed to put our fish?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll figure that out when you actually catch one.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It had been a tense outing aboard the <i>Misty Momma IV. </i>James Mayberry had blown three good strikes because he was unable to absorb instruction. Dragging baits in the ocean was different than jigging for walleyes in the lake back home.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t we need to call somebody?&#x201d; he asked the captain.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We do.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The hairy left arm was bloated and sunburned to the hue of eggplant.<br> &nbsp;<br> A cusp of yellowed humerus protruded at the point of separation, below the shoulder. The flesh surrounding the wound looked ragged and bloodless.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yo, check it out!&#x201d; the mate said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What now?&#x201d; James Mayberry asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;His freakin&#x2019; finger, dude.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The victim&#x2019;s hand was contracted into a first except for the middle digit, which was rigidly extended.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How weird is <i>that</i>? He&#x2019;s flippin&#x2019; us off,&#x201d; the mate said.<br> &nbsp;<br> The captain told him to re-bait the angler&#x2019;s hook.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Has this ever happened out here before?&#x201d; James Mayberry said. &#x201c;Tell the truth.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You should go see about your wife.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Jesus, I&#x2019;ll never hear the end of it. Louisa wanted to ride the Conch Train today. She did <i>not </i>want to come fishing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, son,&#x201d; the captain said, &#x201c;we&#x2019;re in the memory-making business.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> He climbed back to the bridge, radioed the Coast Guard and gave the GPS coordinates of the gruesome find. He was asked to remain in the area and look for other pieces of the body.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I got a charter,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You can stay at it,&#x201d; the Coast Guard dispatcher advised. &#x201c;Just keep your eyes open.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> After calming herself, Louisa Mayberry informed her husband that she wished to return to Key West right away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, sugar. It&#x2019;s a beautiful morning.&#x201d; James Mayberry didn&#x2019;t want to go back to the dock with no fish to hang on the spikes&#x2014;not after shelling out a grand to hire the boat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The first day of our honeymoon, and <i>this</i>! Aren&#x2019;t you sketched out?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James Mayberry peeked under the lid of the fish box. &#x201c;You watch <i>CSI </i>all the time. It&#x2019;s the same type of deal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His wife grimaced but did not turn away. She remarked that the limb didn&#x2019;t look real.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s real,&#x201d; said James Mayberry, somewhat defensively. &#x201c;Just take a whiff.&#x201d; Snagging a fake arm wouldn&#x2019;t make for as good a story.<br> A real arm was pure gold, major high-fives from all his peeps back in Madison. <i>You caught a </i>what<i>? No way, bro!</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Louisa Mayberry&#x2019;s gaze was fixed on the limb. &#x201c;What could have happened?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Tiger shark,&#x201d; her husband said matter-of-factly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is that a wedding band on his hand? This is so sad.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fish on!&#x201d; the mate called. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James Mayberry steered his bride to the fighting chair and the mate fitted the rod into the gimbal. Although she was petite, Louisa Mayberry owned a strong upper body due to rigorous Bikram yoga classes that she took on Tuesday nights. Refusing assistance, she pumped in an eleven-pound blackfi n tuna and whooped triumphantly as it flopped on the deck. Her husband had never seen her so excited.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here, take a picture!&#x201d; she cried to the mate, and handed over her iPhone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hold on,&#x201d; James Mayberry said. &#x201c;Get both of us together.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Louisa watched him hustle to get ready. &#x201c;Really, Jimmy? Really?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Moments later the captain glanced down from the bridge and saw the mate snapping photographs of the newlyweds posed side by side at the transom. Their matching neon blue Oakley wraparounds were propped on their matching cap visors, and their fair Wisconsin noses practically glowed with sunblock.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louisa Mayberry was gamely hoisting by the tail her sleek silvery tuna while James Mayberry wore the mate&#x2019;s crusty gloves to grip his rancid catch, its middle finger aimed upward toward the puffy white clouds.<br> &nbsp;<br> The captain dragged on a cigarette and turned back to the wheel.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Another fucking day in paradise,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>Little Owl Lost</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A debut that reads like a tattered old favorite.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>Uh-oh! Little Owl has fallen from his nest, and his mommy is nowhere to be seen! With the earnest help of his new friend Squirrel, Little Owl goes in search of animals that fit his description of Mommy Owl. But while some are big (like a bear) or have pointy ears (like a bunny), none of them have all the features that make up his mommy. A cast of adorable forest critters in retro, neon-bright hues will engage little readers right up to the story&#x2019;s comforting conclusion.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>PreS&#x2013;Haughton's simple story line, retro colors, and folksy artwork bring a fresh view to an often-used plot. Little Owl falls from the nest while sleeping. He meets a squirrel who promises to help him find his mother, but Squirrel uses each descriptor (&#x201c;Big Eyes,&#x201d; &#x201c;Pointy Ears&#x201d;) to find the wrong animal. Finally, they meet Frog, who says: &#x201c;I know your mommy....Your mommy's looking everywhere for you.&#x201d; Owl and owlet are reunited, and the new friends are invited up for cookies. The spare, repetitive text is just right for a preschool audience, and will quickly have young listeners chiming in with &#x201c;That's not my mommy.&#x201d; Haughton's pitch-perfect use of language flows smoothly to the satisfying end. The pencil and digitally rendered illustrations, which have the feel of a mix of woodblock and cut-paper collage, are done in intense, saturated colors of olive, red, orange, fuchsia, blue, and yellow. Little Owl is black with blue and purple accents and bright eyes, and stands out boldly on both the color-saturated pages and the stark white ones. The art does a wonderful job of conveying movement and encouraging page turns. This little gem will work equally well in storytimes or one-on-one.&#x2013;Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2010.

They grow up the way puppies do, and at first they all look exactly alike. But after nine weeks Pretzel starts growing - and growing - and growing! Fully grown, Pretzel is the longest dachshund in all the world. He easily wins a blue ribbon at the dog show and is admired by everyone - everyone but Greta, the little dachshund across the street, who doesn&#39;t care for long dogs. Pretzel is unable to win Greta&#39;s heart until the day she needs rescuing, when the only dog who can save her must be very, very long. This classic story of puppy love will win the hearts of both old and new Pretzel fans. How can you go wrong with a story that begins and ends with puppies?</p><p>The Reys were born in Hamburg, Germany. <b>Hans Augusto Rey</b> (1898-1977) met his wife-to-be, <b>Margret</b> (1906-1996), at a party in her father&#x2019;s home in Germany; when he first caught a glimpse of her, she was sliding down the banister. In their twenties and thirties they lived in Paris and in Rio de Janeiro, where Hans sold bathtubs in villages along the Amazon River. Eventually Cambridge, Massachusetts, became the Reys&#x2019; home and community. Throughout their lives the Reys created many lively books together, including SPOTTY, PRETZEL, and lift-the-flap books such as HOW DO YOU GET THERE? The manuscript of the first Curious George books was one of the few items the Reys carried with them on their bicycles when they escaped from Paris in 1940. Eventually, they made their way to the United States, and CURIOUS GEORGE was published in 1941. Their incorrigible little monkey has become an American icon, selling millions of books and capturing the hearts of readers everywhere. CURIOUS GEORGE has been published in many languages, including French, German, Japanese, Afrikaans, and Norwegian. Additional Curious George books followed, as well as such other favorites as CECILY G. AND THE NINE MONKEYS and FIND THE CONSTELLATIONS.

After the Reys escaped Paris by bicycle in 1940 carrying the manuscript for the original&nbsp;<i>Curious George</i>, the book was published in America in 1941.

Chapter introductions clarify key concepts, and notes and a glossary explain Sanskrit terms.<br><br> Easwaran grew up in the Hindu tradition in India, and learned Sanskrit from a young age. He was a professor of English literature before coming to the West on a Fulbright scholarship. A gifted teacher, he is recognized as an authority on the Indian classics and world mysticism.<br><br> The Bhagavad Gita opens, dramatically, on a battlefield, as the warrior Arjuna turns in anguish to his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, for answers to the fundamental questions of life. Yet, as Easwaran points out, the Gita is not what it seems &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not a dialogue between two mythical figures at the dawn of Indian history. &#x201c;The battlefield is a perfect backdrop, but the Gita&#x2019;s subject is the war within, the struggle for self-mastery that every human being must wage if he or she is to emerge from life victorious.&#x201d;<br><br>Arjuna&#x2019;s struggle in the Bhagavad Gita is acutely modern. He has lost his way on the battlefield of life and turns to find the path again by asking direct, uncompromising questions of his spiritual guide, Sri Krishna, the Lord himself. Krishna replies in 700 verses of sublime instruction on living and dying, loving and working, and the nature of the soul.<br><br>Easwaran shows the Gita&#x2019;s relevance to us today as we strive, like Arjuna, to do what is right.<br><br><i>&#x201c;No one in modern times is more qualified &#x2013; no, make that &#x2018;as qualified&#x2019; &#x2013; to translate the epochal Classics of Indian Spirituality than Eknath Easwaran. And the reason is clear. It is impossible to get to the heart of those classics unless you live them, and he did live them. My admiration of the man and his works is boundless.&#x201d;</i> &#x2013; Huston Smith, author of <i>The World&#x2019;s Religions.</i></p><p>Easwaran grew up in the Hindu tradition in India, and learned Sanskrit from a young age.

In Hollywood: Deluxe Edition</h2><p><b>Have you found Waldo&#x2019;s special deluxe editions yet?</b><br><br>Another classic Waldo adventure has received the deluxe treatment!&nbsp;<br>Prepare to find:<br>A striking jacketed cover<br>An original collectible poster on the underside of the jacket<br>A spot-the-difference game on the cover<br>A gatefold with checklists on every spread<br>Never-before-seen sections of artwork in each scene<br>New things to search for!</p><p><b>Martin Handford</b>, the man behind the mind-boggling Waldo books, began his career as a freelance illustrator specializing in drawing crowd scenes. "I can&#x2019;t tell you how pleased I am that Waldo has taken on a life of his own," he says. "I&#x2019;d like to inspire children to open their minds to explore subjects more, to be aware of what&#x2019;s going on around them. I&#x2019;d like them to see wonder in places that may not have occurred to them." Martin Handford lives in England.He's back--and as enticingly elusive as ever. Here the bespectacled wanderer travels to Tinseltown to hide out on 12 actor- and crew-packed movie sets. Among the epic productions he witnesses are a reenactment of a battle between the Trojans and the Greeks; the tale of Ali Baba and the 40-plus thieves; the adventures of the (many more than three) musketeers; and a grand skirmish between Robin Hood's myriad merry men and the soldiers of Nottingham Castle. In addition to Waldo (who is usually visible only from the neck up), Wenda, Wizard Whitebeard, bad-guy Odlaw and Woof ("Remember, all you can see is his tail!") are also artfully camouflaged on each riotous spread--as are a minuscule scroll, bone, key and can of film. Handford outdoes himself in the oversize volume's final scene, depicting the filming of "Where's Waldo? The Musical," which entails a stageful of one genuine--and countless impostors of--Waldo and each of his colleagues. Filled with witty puns and plays on Hollywood cliches, Handford's trademark checklists of "lots more things for Waldo-watchers to look for" conclude this clever book. Allegedly three years in the making, this production was worth waiting for.

He went on to write more than twenty-five novels, including The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men.<p>Preface<br> &nbsp;<br> This is the story of Danny and of Danny&#x2019;s friends and of Danny&#x2019;s house. It is a story of how these three became one thing, so that in Tortilla Flat if you speak of Danny&#x2019;s house you do not mean a structure of wood flaked with old whitewash, overgrown with an ancient untrimmed rose of Castile. No, when you speak of Danny&#x2019;s house you are understood to mean a unit of which the parts are men, from which came sweetness and joy, philanthropy and, in the end, a mystic sorrow. For Danny&#x2019;s house was not unlike the Round Table, and Danny&#x2019;s friends were not unlike the knights of it. And this is the story of how that group came into being, of how it flourished and grew to be an organization beautiful and wise. This story deals with the adventuring of Danny&#x2019;s friends, with the good they did, with their thoughts and their endeavors. In the end, this story tells how the talisman was lost and how the group disintegrated.<br> &nbsp;<br> In Monterey, that old city on the coast of California, these things are well known, and they are repeated and sometimes elaborated. It is well that this cycle be put down on paper so that in a future time scholars, hearing the legends, may not say as they say of Arthur and of Roland and of Robin Hood&#x2014;&#x201c;There was no Danny nor any group of Danny&#x2019;s friends, nor any house. Danny is a nature god and his friends primitive symbols of the wind, the sky, the sun.&#x201d; This history is designed now and ever to keep the sneers from the lips of sour scholars.<br> &nbsp;<br> Monterey sits on the slope of a hill, with a blue bay below it and with a forest of tall dark pine trees at its back. The lower parts of the town are inhabited by Americans, Italians, catchers and canners of fish. But on the hill where the forest and the town intermingle, where the streets are innocent of asphalt and the corners free of street lights, the old inhabitants of Monterey are embattled as the Ancient Britons are embattled in Wales. These are the paisanos.<br> &nbsp;<br> They live in old wooden houses set in weedy yards, and the pine trees from the forest are about the houses. The paisanos are clean of commercialism, free of the complicated systems of American business, and, having nothing that can be stolen, exploited, or mortgaged, that system has not attacked them very vigorously.<br> &nbsp;<br> What is a paisano? He is a mixture of Spanish, Indian, Mexican, and assorted Caucasian bloods. His ancestors have lived in California for a hundred or two years. He speaks English with a paisano accent and Spanish with a paisano accent. When questioned concerning his race, he indignantly claims pure Spanish blood and rolls up his sleeve to show that the soft inside of his arm is nearly white. His color, like that of a well-browned meerschaum pipe, he ascribes to sunburn. He is a paisano, and he lives in the uphill district above the town of Monterey called Tortilla Flat, although it isn&#x2019;t a flat at all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny was a paisano, and he grew up in Tortilla Flat and everyone liked him, but he did not stand out particularly from the screeching children of Tortilla Flat. He was related to nearly everyone in the Flat by blood or romance. His grandfather was an important man who owned two small houses in Tortilla Flat and was respected for his wealth. If the growing Danny preferred to sleep in the forest, to work on ranches, and to wrest his food and wine from an unwilling world, it was not because he did not have influential relatives. Danny was small and dark and intent. At twenty-five his legs were bent to the exact curves of a horse&#x2019;s sides.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now when Danny was twenty-five years old, the war with Germany was declared. Danny and his friend Pilon (Pilon, by the way, is something thrown in when a trade is conducted&#x2014;a boot) had two gallons of wine when they heard about the war. Big Joe Portagee saw the glitter of the bottles among the pines and he joined Danny and Pilon.<br> &nbsp;<br> As the wine went down in the bottles, patriotism arose in the three men. And when the wine was gone they went down the hill arm in arm for comradeship and safety, and they walked into Monterey. In front of an enlistment station they cheered loudly for America and dared Germany to do her worst. They howled menaces at the German Empire until the enlistment sergeant awakened and put on his uniform and came into the street to silence them. He remained to enlist them.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sergeant lined them up in front of his desk. They passed everything but the sobriety test and then the sergeant began his questions with Pilon.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What branch do you want to go in?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019; give a god-damn,&#x201d; said Pilon jauntily.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I guess we need men like you in the infantry.&#x201d; And Pilon was written so.<br> &nbsp;<br> He turned then to Big Joe, and the Portagee was getting sober. &#x201c;Where do you want to go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I want to go home,&#x201d; Big Joe said miserably.<br> &nbsp;<br> The sergeant put him in the infantry too. Finally he confronted Danny, who was sleeping on his feet. &#x201c;Where do you want to go?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I say, what branch?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do you mean, &#x2018;branch&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What can you do?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me? I can do anything.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What did you do before?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Me? I&#x2019;m a mule skinner.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, you are? How many mules can you drive?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny leaned forward, vaguely and professionally. &#x201c;How many you got?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;About thirty thousand,&#x201d; said the sergeant.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny waved his hand. &#x201c;String &#x2019;em up!&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so Danny went to Texas and broke mules for the duration of the war. And Pilon marched about Oregon with the infantry, and Big Joe, as shall be later made clear, went to jail.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>How Danny, Home from the Wars, Found Himself an Heir, and How He Swore to Protect the Helpless.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When Danny came home from the army he learned that he was an heir and an owner of property. The&nbsp;<i>viejo,</i>&nbsp;that is the grandfather, had died, leaving Danny the two small houses on Tortilla Flat.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Danny heard about it he was a little weighed down with the responsibility of ownership. Before he ever went to look at his property he bought a gallon of red wine and drank most of it himself. The weight of responsibility left him then, and his very worst nature came to the surface. He shouted; he broke a few chairs in a poolroom on Alvarado Street; he had two short but glorious fights. No one paid much attention to Danny. At last his wavering bowlegs took him toward the wharf where, at this early hour in the morning, the Italian fishermen were walking down in rubber boots to go out to sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> Race antipathy overcame Danny&#x2019;s good sense. He menaced the fishermen. &#x201c;Sicilian bastards,&#x201d; he called them, and &#x201c;Scum from the prison island,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Dogs of dogs of dogs.&#x201d; He cried,&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Chinga tu madre, Piojo.&#x201d;</i>&nbsp;He thumbed his nose and made obscene gestures below his waist. The fishermen only grinned and shifted their oars and said, &#x201c;Hello, Danny. When&#x2019;d you get home? Come around tonight. We got new wine.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny was outraged. He screamed,&nbsp;<i>&#x201c;Pon un condo a la cabeza.&#x201d;</i><br> &nbsp;<br> They called, &#x201c;Good-by, Danny. See you tonight.&#x201d; And they climbed into their little boats and rowed out to the lampara launches and started their engines and chugged away.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny was insulted. He walked back up Alvarado Street, breaking windows as he went, and in the second block a policeman took him in hand. Danny&#x2019;s great respect for the law caused him to go quietly. If he had not just been discharged from the army after the victory over Germany, he would have been sentenced to six months. As it was, the judge gave him only thirty days.<br> &nbsp;<br> And so for one month Danny sat on his cot in the Monterey city jail. Sometimes he drew obscene pictures on the walls, and sometimes he thought over his army career. Time hung heavy on Danny&#x2019;s hands there in his cell in the city jail. Now and then a drunk was put in for the night, but for the most part crime in Monterey was stagnant, and Danny was lonely. The bedbugs bothered him a little at first, but as they got used to the taste of him and he grew accustomed to their bites, they got along peacefully.<br> &nbsp;<br> He started playing a satiric game. He caught a bedbug, squashed it against the wall, drew a circle around it with a pencil and named it &#x201c;Mayor Clough.&#x201d; Then he caught others and named them after the City Council. In a little while he had one wall decorated with squashed bedbugs, each named for a local dignitary. He drew ears and tails on them, gave them big noses and mustaches. Tito Ralph, the jailer, was scandalized; but he made no complaint because Danny had not included either the justice of the peace who had sentenced him or any of the police force. He had a vast respect for the law.<br> &nbsp;<br> One night when the jail was lonely, Tito Ralph came into Danny&#x2019;s cell bearing two bottles of wine. An hour later he went out for more wine, and Danny went with him. It was cheerless in the jail. They stayed at Torrelli&#x2019;s, where they bought the wine, until Torrelli threw them out. After that Danny went up among the pines and fell asleep, while Tito Ralph staggered back and reported his escape.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the brilliant sun awakened Danny about noon, he determined to hide all day to escape pursuit. He ran and dodged behind bushes. He peered out of the undergrowth like a hunted fox. And, at evening, the rules having been satisfied, he came out and went about his business.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny&#x2019;s business was fairly direct. He went to the back door of a restaurant. &#x201c;Got any old bread I can give my dog?&#x201d; he asked the cook. And while that gullible man was wrapping up the food, Danny stole two slices of ham, four eggs, a lamb chop, and a fly swatter.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will pay you sometime,&#x201d; he said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No need to pay for scraps. I throw them away if you don&#x2019;t take them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny felt better about the theft then. If that was the way they felt, on the surface he was guiltless. He went back to Torrelli&#x2019;s, traded the four eggs, the lamb chop, and the fly swatter for a water glass of grappa and retired toward the woods to cook his supper.<br> &nbsp;<br> The night was dark and damp. The fog hung like limp gauze among the black pines that guard the landward limits of Monterey. Danny put his head down and hurried for the shelter of the woods. Ahead of him he made out another hurrying figure; and as he narrowed the distance, he recognized the scuttling walk of his old friend Pilon. Danny was a generous man, but he recalled that he had sold all his food except the two slices of ham and the bag of stale bread.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I will pass Pilon by,&#x201d; he decided. &#x201c;He walks like a man who is full of roast turkey and things like that.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then suddenly Danny noticed the Pilon clutched his coat lovingly across his bosom.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ai, Pilon,&nbsp;<i>amigo!</i>&#x201d; Danny cried.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pilon scuttled on faster. Danny broke into a trot. &#x201c;Pilon, my little friend! Where goest thou so fast?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pilon resigned himself to the inevitable and waited. Danny approached warily, but his tone was enthusiastic. &#x201c;I looked for thee, dearest of little angelic friends, for see, I have here two great steaks from God&#x2019;s own pig, and a sack of sweet white bread. Share my bounty, Pilon, little dumpling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pilon shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;As you say,&#x201d; he muttered savagely. They walked on together into the woods. Pilon was puzzled. At length he stopped and faced his friend. &#x201c;Danny,&#x201d; he asked sadly, &#x201c;how knewest thou I had a bottle of brandy under my coat?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Brandy?&#x201d; Danny cried. &#x201c;Thou hast brandy? Perhaps it is for some sick old mother,&#x201d; he said na�vely. &#x201c;Perhaps thou keepest it for Our Lord Jesus when He comes again. Who am I, thy friend, to judge the destination of this brandy? I am not even sure thou hast it. Besides I am not thirsty. I would not touch this brandy. Thou art welcome to this big roast of pork I have, but as for thy brandy, that is thine own.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pilon answered him sternly. &#x201c;Danny, I do not mind sharing my brandy with you, half and half. It is my duty to see you do not drink it all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny dropped the subject then. &#x201c;Here in the clearing I will cook this pig, and you will toast the sugar cakes in this bag here. Put thy brandy here, Pilon. It is better here, where we can see it, and each other.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> They built a fire and broiled the ham and ate the stale bread. The brandy receded quickly down the bottle. After they had eaten, they huddled near the fire and sipped delicately at the bottle like effete bees. And the fog came down upon them and grayed their coats with moisture. The wind sighed sadly in the pines about them.<br> &nbsp;<br> And after a time a loneliness fell upon Danny and Pilon. Danny thought of his lost friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Where is Arthur Morales?&#x201d; Danny asked, turning his palms up and thrusting his arms forward. &#x201c;Dead in France,&#x201d; he answered himself, turning the palms down and dropping his arms in despair. &#x201c;Dead for his country. Dead in a foreign land. Strangers walk near his grave and they do not know Arthur Morales lies there.&#x201d; He raised his hands palms upward again. &#x201c;Where is Pablo, that good man?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;In jail,&#x201d; said Pilon. &#x201c;Pablo stole a goose and hid in the brush; and that goose bit Pablo and Pablo cried out and so was caught. Now he lies in jail for six months.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny sighed and changed the subject, for he realized that he had prodigally used up the only acquaintance in any way fit for oratory. But the loneliness was still on him and demanded an outlet. &#x201c;Here we sit,&#x201d; he began at last.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;&#x2014;broken-hearted,&#x201d; Pilon added rhythmically.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, this is not a poem,&#x201d; Danny said. &#x201c;Here we sit, homeless. We gave our lives for our country, and now we have no roof over our head.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We never did have,&#x201d; Pilon added helpfully.<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny drank dreamily until Pilon touched his elbow and took the bottle. &#x201c;That reminds me,&#x201d; Danny said, &#x201c;of a story of a man who owned two whorehouses&#x2014;&#x201d; His mouth dropped open. &#x201c;Pilon!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Pilon! My little fat duck of a baby friend. I had forgotten! I am an heir! I own two houses.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Whorehouses?&#x201d; Pilon asked hopefully. &#x201c;Thou art a drunken liar,&#x201d; he continued.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No, Pilon. I tell the truth. The&nbsp;<i>viejo</i>&nbsp;died. I am the heir. I, the favorite grandson.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thou art the only grandson,&#x201d; said the realist Pilon. &#x201c;Where are these houses?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You know the&nbsp;<i>viejo</i>&#x2019;s house on Tortilla Flat, Pilon?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Here in Monterey?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, here in Tortilla Flat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are they any good, these houses?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Danny sank back, exhausted with emotion. &#x201c;I do not know. I forgot I owned them.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pilon sat silent and absorbed. His face grew mournful. He threw a handful of pine needles on the fire, watched the flames climb frantically among them and die. For a long time he looked into Danny&#x2019;s face with deep anxiety, and then Pilon sighed noisily, and again he sighed. &#x201c;Now it is over,&#x201d; he said sadly. &#x201c;Now the great times ...</p></p><h2>John Muir Trail Topographic Map Guide (National Geographic Topographic Map Guide) (National Geographic Topographic Map Guide, 1001)</h2><p><b></b><p><b>� Waterproof � Tear-Resistant � Topographic Map</b></p><p>National Geographic's Map Guide of the John Muir Trail is an indispensable tool for navigating one of the most famous trails in the United States.

Nonsqueamish readers will be entranced by her riveting descriptions of King Tuts mummification (and the brutal treatment that mummy has received in modern times); the thoroughly septic doctoring that hastened or at least contributed to the deaths of Mozart, Napoleon, James A. Garfield, and others; the literal dissolution of Henry VIIIs body (While lying in state, it is believed that his toxic remains exploded, and some of his royal splendidness dripped out the sides of the coffin overnight); and the outrageous fates of Einsteins brain, Galileos fingers, and other coroners souvenirs. The author tucks quick notes on at least marginally relevant topics, such as leeching, scurvy, presidential assassins, and mummy eyes (If mummy eyeballs are rehydrated, they return to almost normal size), between the chapters and closes with generous lists of nontechnical print resources on each of her subjects. OMalleys cartoon portraits and spot art add just the right notes of humor to keep the contents from becoming too gross. Usually.

Grades 5-8. --John Peters</p><h2>Pouch!</h2><p>Caldecott Honor winner David Ezra Stein&#39;s delightful tale of a baby kangaroo&#39;s first hops toward independence is perfect for board book audiences. Joey wants to go exploring, but at first he isn&#39;t sure he&#39;s ready to leave Mama&#39;s safe, warm pouch. Touching on a universal childhood experience, this sweet tale celebrates trying new things.</p><p>David Ezra Stein (www.davidezra.com) received a Caldecott Honor for <i>Interrupting Chicken</i>, a Charlotte Zolotow Honor for <i>Pouch!</i> and the Ezra Jack Keats New Writer Award for <i>Leaves</i>, which was also a Publishers Weekly Best Book of the Year, a Kirkus Reviews Editor's Choice and a School Library Journal Best Book. He also wrote and illustrated <i>The Nice Book</i> and <i>Monster Hug!</i> He lives in Kew Gardens, New York.PreSchool-Grade 1&#x2014;Stein continues to create deceptively simple yet very affecting picture books. One day, little Joey peeks out of Mama Kangaroo's pouch and says, "I want to hop!" Each time he leaves his safe haven, he takes more steps, meets a strange new animal, yells out "Pouch!," and hops back to his mama to hide. But when the final animal is another little joey who also yells "Pouch!," the two realize there is nothing to fear, have a good laugh, and hop off together. When their mamas offer their pouches, the youngsters say, "No, thanks." The marker, watercolor, and crayon illustrations are rendered in Stein's trademark simple, scribbly, loosely drawn style. The increasing distances Joey hops from his mother are clearly represented with increased page turns and use of perspective. Stein's choice of easily identifiable animals (a bee, a rabbit, and a bird) is particularly apropos, giving the book universality that it might otherwise lack. The repetition will appeal to the intended audience, as will the chance to identify each animal Joey meets. The subtle sophistication of the story gives it broad appeal: while it could be used one-on-one with toddlers, older preschoolers would enjoy it in storytimes, and the minimalistic text would be effective with beginning readers as well.&#x2014;<i>Amy Lilien-Harper, The Ferguson Library, Stamford, CT</i> END</p><h2>The Wheels on the Tuk Tuk</h2><p>From the mother-son duo behind the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling <i>A Bucket of Blessings</i> comes a zany picture book about a wild ride on a tuk tuk taxi in India!<br><br>This picture book brings an international twist to the beloved nursery rhyme, The Wheels on the Bus, by bringing you aboard a busy three-wheeled taxi in India!

Books on quilt history have, to date, included only a few photos of quilts. This in-depth collection, most of which has never been seen before, date from 1855 to 1955. Each vivid image provides commentary on quilting specifics, photography, costume, and American cultural history, especially toward the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Photographic formats and a glossary of quilting terms are included to aid the reader in dating their own vintage photographs. This book is a wonderful resource for all quilters, historians, and photographers.</p><p>Janet E.

I, too, actively pursued these in the 1990s and found some really neat ones, but they are so few and far between that it's difficult to imagine a collection of this size. She makes it so much fun by writing one or two paragraphs with each, and sometimes more. A book full of history, and a book that's just plain fun to turn pages. So glad I added it to my overflowing library of quilt history books. - --Wilene Smith<br><br>There have been books on vintage photographs and postcards, and there have been books on antique quilts. But now the topics have been combined and the result is exceptional. Quilts in Everyday Life, 1855-1955 by Janet Finley offers more than 330 images that capture the rich heritage of quilt-making in an impressive way. --Robert Reed, Antique and Collectible News Service, Knightstown, IN<br><br>In years past, women were not encouraged to pursue the fine arts. So they put their artistry into everyday crafts, and quilts were at the top of the list. Women could have stitched together huge blocks of fabric to make bed coverings, but instead, they cut their scraps into shapes and fitted them together to make intricate designs.<br><br>Janet E. Finley, former executive director of the Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum in Golden, CO, has collected these photographs for a decade. She's searched the internet, haunted antiques shops and leaned on friends to put together what may be the largest collection of quilt photographs in the country. These photographs are rare, so the book is a treasure for both historians and quilters. --Sandra Dallas, The Denver Post</p><h2>Tom Stoppard Plays: The Real Inspector Hound/Dirty Linen/Dogg&#39;s Hamlet/Cahoot&#39;s Macbeth/After Magritte/ New-found-land (Contemporary Classics)</h2><p>A collection of Tom Stoppard plays which reflect a combination of the &#34;frivolous&#34; and the &#34;serious&#34; aspects of his talent.</p><p>Tom Stoppard's work includes <i>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</i> <i>,</i> <i> The Real Inspector Hound</i> <i>,</i> <i> Jumpers</i> <i>,</i> <i> Travesties</i> <i>,</i> <i> Night and Day</i> <i>,</i> <i> Every Good Boy Deserves Favour</i> <i>,</i> <i> After Magritte</i> <i>,</i> <i> Dirty Linen</i> <i>, </i> <i>The Real Thing</i> <i>,</i> <i> Hapgood</i> <i>, </i> <i>Arcadia</i> <i>, </i> <i>Indian Ink</i> <i>, </i> <i>The Invention of Love</i>, the trilogy <i>The Coast of Utopia</i> and <i>Rock 'n' Roll</i> <i>.</i> His radio plays include <i>If You're Glad I'll Be Frank</i> <i>, </i> <i>Albert's Bridge</i> <i>,</i> <i> Where Are They Now?</i> <i>,</i> <i> Artist Descending a Staircase</i>, <i>The Dog It Was That Died</i>, <i>In</i> <i> the Native State </i>and <i>Darkside </i>(incorporating Pink Floyd's <i>Dark Side of the Moon</i>).

Jodorowsky was multi-talented from an early age, becoming skilled in puppetry and mime, in addition to writing, by his late teens. He traveled with a pantomime troupe in the 1950s, and within a couple years had made his way to Paris where he collaborated with the world-renowned mime Marcel Marceau. In the 1960s, Jodorowsky ventured further into the world of theater, creating in Mexico, the Panic Movement. This innovative artistic movement allowed him to creatively participate in over a 100 theater productions. The 1970s saw him transition into the world of film where he quickly put a defining stamp on all his cinematic works. He directed several cult films, namely the infamous &#34;El Topo,&#34; a Midnight movie favorite. Shortly thereafter, Jodorowsky became attached to direct the adaptation of the famous Frank Herbert sci-fi epic novel &#34;Dune.&#34; At the preparation stage of the film, he brilliantly assembled a team of extremely diverse and gifted artists such as HR Giger, Chris Foss, Dan O&#39;Bannon, and Moebius, all of who would later be hired as concept artists on Ridley Scott&#39;s &#34;Alien.&#34; The development of &#34;Dune&#34; came to a halt due to financial problems, but Jodorowsky, having been exposed to such immense visual talent, propelled himself into writing graphic novels, pairing up with the artist Moebius. This collaboration resulted in what many consider to be one of the most creative European sci-fi graphic novel series of all time, &#34;The Incal,&#34; which went on to sell millions of copies worldwide. Since penning &#34;The Incal,&#34; Jodorowsky continued writing top selling comic books with a wide variety of Europe&#39;s most talented artists, such as &#34;The White Lama&#34; (with Bess), &#34;The Metabarons&#34; (with Gimenez), &#34;The Technopriests&#34; (with Janjetov), and most recently &#34;Bouncer&#34; (with Boucq). Along with nurturing his many other talents, Jodorowsky remains a unique storyteller whose published contributions have secured his status as one of the world&#39;s most prolific graphic novel writers.<b>***2018 Eisner Award nominee in the Best Comics-Related Books category***</b></p><h2>Mission to the Volga (Library of Arabic Literature)</h2><p><p><b>Earliest surviving instance of sustained first-person travel narrative in Arabic. </b></p><br><p>A pioneering text of peerless historical and literary value.

Upon learning of Lee's surrender, Sam--a runaway slave who once worked for the Union Army--decides to leave his safe haven in Philadelphia and set out on foot to return to the war-torn South. What compels him on this almost-suicidal course is the desire to find his wife, the mother of his only child, whom he and their son left behind 15 years earlier on the Mississippi farm to which they all "belonged."<br><br>At the same time, Sam's wife, Tilda, is being forced to walk at gunpoint with her owner and two of his other slaves from the charred remains of his Mississippi farm into Arkansas, in search of an undefined place that would still respect his entitlements as slaveowner and Confederate officer. <br><br>The book's third main character, Prudence, is a fearless, headstrong white woman of means who leaves her Boston home for Buford, Mississippi, to start a school for the former bondsmen, and thus honor her father&#x2019;s dying wish.<br><br>At bottom, <i>Freeman</i> is a love story--sweeping, generous, brutal, compassionate, patient--about the feelings people were determined to honor, despite the enormous constraints of the times. It is this aspect of the book that should ensure it a strong, vocal, core audience of African-American women, who will help propel its likely critical acclaim to a wider audience. At the same time, this book addresses several themes that are still hotly debated today, some 145 years after the official end of the Civil War. Like <i>Cold Mountain</i>, <i>Freeman</i> illuminates the times and places it describes from a fresh perspective, with stunning results. It has the potential to become a classic addition to the literature dealing with this period. Few other novels so powerfully capture the pathos and possibility of the era particularly as it reflects the ordeal of the black slaves grappling with the promise--and the terror--of their new status as free men and women.</p><p>Leonard Pitts, Jr. was born and raised in Southern California and now lives in suburban Washington, DC, with his wife and children.

The mother of three boys, she lives in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky.Chapter One<br><br>If Charlie Stone hadn&#x2019;t drunk the Kool-Aid, she would have died.<br><br>But in the random way the world sometimes works, the seventeen-year-old did drink several big tumblers full of Goofy Grape generously mixed with vodka, courtesy of her new best friend Holly Palmer. As a result, she just happened to be in the utilitarian bathroom off the Palmers&#x2019; basement rec room, hugging the porcelain throne when the first scream penetrated her consciousness.<br><br>Even muffled by floors and walls and who knew what else, it was loud and shrill and urgent enough to penetrate the haze of misery she was lost in.<br><br>&#x201c;Holly?&#x201d; Charlie called, lifting her head, which felt like it weighed a ton and pounded unmercifully.<br><br>No answer.<br><br>Okay, her voice was weak. Probably Holly hadn&#x2019;t heard her. Probably the scream was nothing, Holly&#x2019;s little brothers fighting or something. Seeing that it was around two a.m., though, shouldn&#x2019;t the eleven- and thirteen-year-olds have been asleep? Charlie had no idea: she knew nothing about tweenie boys. God, she should have followed her instinct and just said no to the booze. But as the new girl in Hampton High School&#x2019;s senior class, Charlie hadn&#x2019;t felt like she was in a position to refuse. From the first day of school, when they&#x2019;d found out they were sharing a locker, sweet, popular Holly had taken Charlie under her wing, introduced her around. For that, Charlie was grateful. The veteran of seven high schools in just over three years, Charlie knew from bitter experience that there were a lot more mean girls out there than nice ones.<br><br>A late August Friday night in this small North Carolina beach town meant the movies. Four of them had gone together. The other two had moms who were reliable about picking their daughters up after. When Charlie&#x2019;s mom hadn&#x2019;t shown (typical), Holly had invited her to spend the night. They&#x2019;d wound up sneaking out to meet Holly&#x2019;s boyfriend, Garrett--a total hottie, who had to work till midnight, which was past Holly&#x2019;s curfew--and go for a ride in his car. Since he&#x2019;d had a friend with him--James, not quite as hot as Garrett, but still--it had actually worked out pretty well, except for the whole toxic Kool-Aid thing.<br><br>They&#x2019;d driven to the shore, plopped down in the sand, and shared the concoction Garrett had mixed for them while they talked and watched the waves.<br><br>The good news was, Charlie might actually have gotten a bead on landing her own boyfriend. The bad news was, as soon as Garrett had dropped them off and they&#x2019;d crept back down to the basement where supposedly they&#x2019;d been watching TV all along, Charlie had had to rush straight to the bathroom. She&#x2019;d been in there for what felt like forever, being sick as a parrot.<br><br>She&#x2019;d be lucky if Holly ever invited her over again.<br><br>The second scream definitely did not come from one of the boys. High-pitched and shattering, it smashed through the ordinary sounds of the babbling TV and humming air-conditioning and thumping dryer in the next room like an axe through Jell-O. The fear in it was enough to make the hair stand up on the back of Charlie&#x2019;s neck. Until it abruptly cut off, she forgot to breathe. The ensuing silence pulsated with . . . something. Tension, maybe. An electric kind of heaviness. Shooting to her feet, she swiped her long brown hair back from her face with one hand and headed for the door. Knees weak, battling a disorienting attack of the woozies along with the worst taste ever in her mouth, she grabbed the cold-from-the-air-conditioning brass knob.<br><br>&#x201c;Teach you to ignore me . . .&#x201d; The words were followed by the sharp sound of a blow. It was a man&#x2019;s voice, low and deep. Mr. Palmer? Had he found out they&#x2019;d snuck out?<br><br>Charlie froze, her hand still on the knob. She could see herself in the mirror over the sink. Average height, maybe a little too plump. Her face, cute, round, currently rosy from her mostly futile attempts to tan, had gone utterly white. Her blue eyes were the approximate size and shape of golf balls. The yellow T-shirt she wore with jeans looked neon bright in the drab space. Tonight there would be no blending in to the background for her. Earlier, standing out was what she had wanted. Her yet-to-be-proven theory was that, unlike birds, brilliant plumage on girls helped to attract boys. Whatever, James had seemed to like her.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go anywhere,&#x201d; the man said. At the ugly note in his voice, Charlie let go of the knob and took a step back. Pulse pounding, she stared at the raw wood panel. The tiny bathroom with its plain white toilet and sink and unpainted concrete block walls seemed to shrink as she stood there. There was no window, no way out except through that door.<br><br>Her heart thudded so hard she could feel it knocking in her chest.<br><br>A moment later the unmistakable creak of the door to the rec room told her it was being opened. She didn&#x2019;t hear it shut, but then she didn&#x2019;t hear anything after that. No footsteps, no voices. What was happening? Was he gone? Where was Holly?<br><br>All Charlie knew for sure was that she wasn&#x2019;t about to just open that door.<br><br>Instead she dropped to her knees and tried looking beneath it, through the crack between door and floor.<br><br>The overhead light was still on, just like it was when she&#x2019;d run for the bathroom. She could see the rug, a tan kind of Aztec print laid down over the concrete. She could see two legs of the coffee table, and a sliver of the tan leather couch. And Holly&#x2019;s feet. Yes, definitely Holly&#x2019;s feet, bare like her own. Slim and tanned, toenails painted bubblegum pink, poking out from beneath the fashionably raggedy hems of her jeans.<br><br>Judging from their position, Holly was lying on her side on the floor between the coffee table and the couch.<br><br>Charlie wet her lips. Something bad had happened. Something was really wrong.<br><br>Even as Charlie watched, Holly&#x2019;s toes curled, straightened, curled again. Then Charlie heard a moan, low and drawn out. Her stomach bunched into a big knot. The moan came from Holly, no mistake about that. Whatever had gone down, Holly was hurt. She needed help. Had her dad beaten her up?<br><br>Mr. Palmer--Ben, all Holly&#x2019;s friends called him, although Charlie, who&#x2019;d only met him twice, hadn&#x2019;t quite gotten there yet--was a lawyer. He seemed nice, not like the type who&#x2019;d hit his daughter, but in Charlie&#x2019;s experience of men, you just never knew.<br><br>The door to the rec room was open, she could see that much. There was no sign of the man, no sound from him. In her gut Charlie felt he was gone.<br><br>Standing up, Charlie took a deep breath. Then slowly, carefully, she eased open the door.<br><br>Just a crack. Just enough to see.<br><br>As she had thought, Holly lay on the floor, on her side. Her taut, tanned, cheerleader-worthy midriff was visible from the top of her hip bones to halfway up her rib cage because her hot pink tee was pulled way up. It was pulled way up because her arms were raised above her head in the most awkward-looking position ever. Charlie&#x2019;s heart stuttered as she took in the silver bracelets circling Holly&#x2019;s wrists, recognized them as handcuffs, and registered that Holly was handcuffed to the black plumbing pipe that rose along the room&#x2019;s concrete block outer wall.<br><br>Oh, my God.<br><br>Holly&#x2019;s dad hadn&#x2019;t done that.<br><br>A swift glance around assured Charlie there was no one else in the room. So nervous she almost vibrated with it, Charlie hesitated. But what else could she do? Pulse racing, she flew to her friend&#x2019;s side, nudging the coffee table out of the way, careful not to make a sound. Holly&#x2019;s eyes were closed, she saw as she crouched beside her. Blood trickled from a cut just above her temple. The thread of bright scarlet sliding along Holly&#x2019;s cheekbone horrified Charlie almost as much as the two strips of gray duct tape plastered over her friend&#x2019;s mouth.<br><br>Oh, God. Oh, no. What do I do?<br><br>Panic tightened her throat, but she did her best to force it back. Cold sweat prickled to life around her hairline, beaded her upper lip.<br><br>&#x201c;Holly.&#x201d; Charlie&#x2019;s whisper was urgent. She grabbed Holly&#x2019;s arm, shook her. Whatever had happened, this was something way outside her experience. Way outside her ability to deal with. Casting terrified glances over her shoulder, she frantically felt the smooth metal handcuffs, felt the cool strength of the chain linking them, felt the solidity of the iron pipe they were wrapped around. No way were they coming off without the key. Her friend&#x2019;s hands felt warm, but they were limp and almost colorless except for the pink of her nail polish. &#x201c;Holly, wake up.&#x201d;<br><br>Holly&#x2019;s eyes opened. The pupils were enormously dilated, making her blue eyes look almost black. For a moment she blinked, unfocused. Then she saw Charlie and seemed to regain awareness.<br><br>&#x201c;Mmm.&#x201d; Holly moved in agitation. She turned her head, twisting, struggling to get free. The handcuffs clanked against the pipe. She kicked the coffee table, the sound of her feet hitting the wood loud as a clap to Charlie&#x2019;s suddenly hypersensitive ears. Charlie&#x2019;s heart leaped. She cast another of those terrified glances at the door.<br><br>If the man should come back . . . <br><br>Fear twisted inside her like a knife.<br><br>Grabbing Holly&#x2019;s arm again, Charlie shook her head in an emphatic no.<br><br>&#x201c;Shh,&#x201d; she warned. Holly&#x2019;s eyes met hers and clung, begging her. Fingers trembling, Charlie reached for the edge of the duct tape. Scrabbling at the edges, she managed to pull it off. The sticky side clung to her fingers. She had to pull the doubled strips off with her other hand, then stuck the tape on the wall.<br><br>&#x201c;Do something. Get me out of here. He just walked in. He hit me.&#x201d; The words spilled so fast out of Holly&#x2019;s mouth they tumbled over one another. Her face was shiny with sweat. Her eyes were huge and glassy, her mouth blurry and smashed-looking from the tape.<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d; Grabbing one of the metal rings with both hands, Charlie tried yanking the cuff open.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. A stranger. Hurry.&#x201d;<br><br>The cuff didn&#x2019;t give by so much as a millimeter. Neither did the other. Upstairs, another scream split the night. This one was loud, guttural, animal-like. Charlie&#x2019;s hands dropped away from the chain she was attempting to separate from the metal bracelets as a chill raced down her spine. Holly went completely still.<br><br>&#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Holly whimpered. Her eyes darted around the room. &#x201c;Oh, God, what&#x2019;s happening? Help me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shh. I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d; Desperately Charlie yanked at the pipe. Solidly set into the wall, it didn&#x2019;t budge. Rolling onto her knees, Holly started yanking at the pipe, too. Clank, clank, clank, went the handcuffs.<br><br>&#x201c;You have to be quiet.&#x201d; Charlie&#x2019;s voice was low but sharp. &#x201c;If he hears you . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got my mother. Oh, my God, what if he comes back to the basement?&#x201d; Frantic, panting, Holly grabbed the pipe and tried to break it free of the wall. Thud, thud. Clank, clank. &#x201c;You have to help me get out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>Terror sent goose bumps racing over Charlie&#x2019;s skin. She shot another frightened look at the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Holly. Stop it. Be quiet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have to help me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shut up.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlie&#x2019;s palms were damp with sweat. She let go of the pipe. Holly wasn&#x2019;t the only one at risk here. If the man came back, if he caught her, if he found out she was here, whatever this terrible thing was could happen to her, too. The knowledge dried Charlie&#x2019;s mouth, sent her pulse into overdrive.<br><br>She stood up abruptly. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get you loose. I have to go for help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t leave me.&#x201d; Holly&#x2019;s eyes blazed with fear. Strands of her long blond hair hit Charlie&#x2019;s face as Holly whipped her head around so that she was facing the wall. Scrambling into a crouch, Holly yanked desperately at the pipe, trying to free her trapped hands. Even as she was backing away, Charlie smelled the citrus-y scent of her friend&#x2019;s perfume. Holly was sweating bullets, Charlie realized. Just like she was herself.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to. I have to go.&#x201d; Anguish made Charlie&#x2019;s voice break as she continued to back away.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; The handcuffs clanked as Holly kept trying to free herself. Her head turned to track Charlie&#x2019;s progress. Her eyes clung desperately to Charlie&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t just leave me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Be quiet, he&#x2019;ll hear you. I&#x2019;ll be as quick as I can.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Please. Please.&#x201d; Holly started to sob as Charlie, able to take no more, turned her back on her and ran from the room. Charlie&#x2019;s throat went tight. Her heart hung heavy as a bowling ball in her chest. Leaving her friend behind was one of the hardest things Charlie had ever had to do in her life. But getting help was the only smart thing to do, she told herself. She could use the phone, or run to a neighbor. What she couldn&#x2019;t do was free Holly herself. And if the man caught her . . .<br><br>She couldn&#x2019;t finish the thought. Fear washed over her in a cold wave.<br><br>The stairs were in the unfinished part of the basement, the part that held the washer and dryer and furnace and water heater. Out the rec room door, turn left, and there they were.<br><br>Charlie hesitated at the foot, looking up. Her heart pounded. Her pulse raced. The door at the top of the stairs was closed. It opened, she knew, into the kitchen. Concentrating hard as she crept up the stairs, hanging on to the handrail, moving as quietly as it was possible to move, Charlie tried to picture the Palmers&#x2019; kitchen. Big and modern, it had an island in the center where she and Holly and the other girls had chowed down on pizza earlier. And yes, in the far corner, beside the refrigerator, was the back door. All she had to do was make it to that door, then race across the backyard to the next house just yards away. Forget trying to call for help: she was better off getting out of the house and running to the next-door neighbor as fast as she could go.<br><br>I can&#x2019;t let him catch me. Even forming the words in her mind made shivers race over her skin.<br><br>Pausing on the top step, listening intently at the closed door, she heard nothing beyond the normal sounds of the house. But she knew people were up there, in the main part of the house: for one thing, Holly&#x2019;s family had to be there. And the man--where was he? Who was he?<br><br>Oh, God, if he decides to come into the basement now . . . <br><br>The thought was so horrifying Charlie felt faint.<br><br>Holding her breath, she turned the knob with infinite care, then pushed the door open the merest sliver.</p><h2>STAR WARS: POE DAMERON VOL. 4 - LEGEND FOUND</h2><p>The galaxy's greatest pilot flies on!

Delving into the prevalence of early democracy throughout the world, David Stasavage makes the case that understanding how and where these democracies flourished&#x2015;and when and why they declined&#x2015;can provide crucial information not just about the history of governance, but about the ways modern democracies work and where they could manifest in the future. </p><p>Drawing from examples spanning several millennia, Stasavage first considers why states developed either democratic or autocratic styles of governance and argues that early democracy tended to develop in small places with a weak state and, counterintuitively, simple technologies.

And what a show it is, with a grand finale that has thirty sequined Elvis impersonators high-kicking in unison! From the front row, "Mouse" and "Sister" have a perfect view of the action when one of the dancing Kings keels over dead into the bandstand. This Elvis clone has not only left the building ... he's left this life, courtesy of a switchblade knife in the back. And when the murder weapon turns up in Patricia Anne's very sensible purse, the perennially law-abiding "Mouse" is understandably all shook up. Suspicious minds have her pegged as the prime suspect in this bizarre case of Elvis elimination. And if she doesn't do some serious sleuthing, she could end up doing the Jailhouse Rock!</p></p><p>Anne George (c.____ - 2001) was the Agatha Award-winning author of the <em>Southern Sisters</em> mystery series which culminate in <em>Murder Boogies with Elvis</em>, publishing in August 2001. Like Patricia Anne, she was a happily married former school teacher living in Birmingham, Alabama. Ms. George was also a former Alabama State Poet and a regular contributor to literary publications. During her lifetime she was nominated for several awards, including the Pulitzer. Being a true lady of the Old South, her date of birth will forever be a mystery.Y'all want lots of good laughs with a grisly murder and some clever detecting thrown in? Join the sexagenarian southern sisters, Mary Alice, a six-footer, and Patricia Anne, a size-six petite. In their eighth adventure from Agatha-winner George (Murder on a Girls' Night Out; Murder on a Bad Hair Day; etc.), Mary Alice, survivor of three marriages, is about to wed her fourth husband, Virgil Stukey, sheriff of Alabama's St. Clair County. At a benefit at a restored theater, a chorus line of Elvis impersonators performs in white jumpsuits; 30 Elvises boogie to the footlights and acknowledge the applause, but only 29 withdraw. One pitches headfirst into the pit, landing only a few feet from the sisters, who have come to cheer for Virgil and his brother-in-law, both Elvis impersonators who just happen to have been on either side of the dead "pitcher." Several days later Patricia Anne, rummaging in her purse, finds a large, rusty switchblade, which turns out to be the murder weapon. She goes to jail. The complications in this delectable tale are legion. The dialogue is so true and natural that it could go straight to stage or film. Inspired name choices include the sisters Dawn, Day and Dusk, as well as a lad called Pukey Lukey (because he's subject to motion sickness). If you're not already a fan, you'll want to find the earlier books, especially since the author died in March. Angels are laughing with her now for the joy she gave so many.

Almost all of his work is presented here - from his paintings and frescos, to detailed reproductions of his remarkable encrypted notebooks.</p><p>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (April 15, 1452 - May 2, 1519) was an Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. Leonardo was and is renowned primarily as a painter. Among his works, the Mona Lisa is the most famous and most parodied portrait and The Last Supper, the most reproduced religious painting of all time, with their fame approached only by Michelangelo&#39;s The Creation of Adam. Leonardo&#39;s drawing of the Vitruvian Man is also regarded as a cultural icon.</p><h2>Robins!: How They Grow Up</h2><p>Robins are the most familiar and beloved of all birds, found throughout North America and celebrated as one of the first signs of spring.

The big problem facing managers and their organizations today is one of implementation--how to get things done in a timely and effective way. Problems of implementation are really issues of how to influence behavior, change the course of events, overcome resistance, and get people to do things they would not otherwise do. In a word, power. <i>Managing With Power</i> provides an in-depth look at the role of power and influence in organizations. Pfeffer shows convincingly that its effective use is an essential component of strong leadership. With vivid examples, he makes a compelling case for the necessity of power in mobilizing the political support and resources to get things done in any organization. He provides an intriguing look at the personal attributes&#x2014;such as flexibility, stamina, and a high tolerance for conflict&#x2014;and the structural factors&#x2014;such as control of resources, access to information, and formal authority&#x2014;that can help managers advance organizational goals and achieve individual success.</p><p>Jeffrey Pfeffer is Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University.

With the growing popularity of digital games and game-based interfaces, it is essential that gamification be part of every learning professional's tool box. In this comprehensive resource, international learning expert Karl M. Kapp reveals the value of game-based mechanics to create meaningful learning experiences. Drawing together the most current information and relevant research in one resource, <i>The Gamification of Learning and Instruction</i> shows how to create and design games that are effective and meaningful for learners. </p><p>Kapp introduces, defines, and describes the concept of gamification and then dissects several examples of games to determine the elements that provide the most positive results for the players.

Not so today. In seeking to answer fundamental questions about how biological systems function and change over time, the modern biologist is as likely to rely on sophisticated mathematical and computer-based models as traditional fieldwork. In this book, Sarah Otto and Troy Day provide biology students with the tools necessary to both interpret models and to build their own.</p><br><p> The book starts at an elementary level of mathematical modeling, assuming that the reader has had high school mathematics and first-year calculus. Otto and Day then gradually build in depth and complexity, from classic models in ecology and evolution to more intricate class-structured and probabilistic models. The authors provide primers with instructive exercises to introduce readers to the more advanced subjects of linear algebra and probability theory. Through examples, they describe how models have been used to understand such topics as the spread of HIV, chaos, the age structure of a country, speciation, and extinction.</p><br><p> Ecologists and evolutionary biologists today need enough mathematical training to be able to assess the power and limits of biological models and to develop theories and models themselves.

(Talking Politics)</p><h2>Complex Variables (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>A caution to mathematics professors: <i>Complex Variables </i>does not follow conventional outlines of course material. One reviewer noting its originality wrote: "A standard text is often preferred [to a superior text like this] because the professor knows the order of topics and the problems, and doesn't really have to pay attention to the text. He can go to class without preparation." Not so here &#x2014; Dr. Flanigan treats this most important field of contemporary mathematics in a most unusual way. While all the material for an advanced undergraduate or first-year graduate course is covered, discussion of complex algebra is delayed for 100 pages, until harmonic functions have been analyzed from a real variable viewpoint. Students who have forgotten or never dealt with this material will find it useful for the subsequent functions. In addition, analytic functions are defined in a way which simplifies the subsequent theory. Contents include: Calculus in the Plane, Harmonic Functions in the Plane, Complex Numbers and Complex Functions, Integrals of Analytic Functions, Analytic Functions and Power Series, Singular Points and Laurent Series, The Residue Theorem and the Argument Principle, and Analytic Functions as Conformal Mappings. <br>Those familiar with mathematics texts will note the fine illustrations throughout and large number of problems offered at the chapter ends. An answer section is provided. Students weary of plodding mathematical prose will find Professor Flanigan's style as refreshing and stimulating as his approach. <br></p><p></p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Physical Chemistry (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p><b>Confusing Textbooks?

Issues of interreligious engagement, inclusive of dialogue more specifically and relations more generally, attract widespread interest and concern. In a religiously pluralist world, how different communities get along with each other is not just an academic question; it is very much a focus of socio-political and wider community attention. The study of religions and religion in the 21st century world must necessarily take account of relations within and between religions, whether this is approached from a theological, historical, political, or any other disciplinary point of view. <br><br><em>Understanding Interreligious Relations</em> is a reference work of relevance to students and scholars as well as of interest to a wider informed public. It comprises two main parts. The first provides expositions and critical discussions of the ways in which "the other" has been construed and addressed from within the major religious traditions. The second presents analysis and discussions of key issues and topics in which interreligious relations are an integral constituent.<br><br>The editors have assembled an authoritative and scholarly work that discusses perspectives on the religious "other" and interreligious relations that are typical of the major religious traditions; together with substantial original chapters from a cross-section of emerging and established scholars on main debates and issues in the wider field of interreligious relations.</p><p><br><strong>David Cheetham</strong> has been teaching and researching the theology and philosophy of religions for over 15 years.

So it <i>was </i>yours?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah . . . I . . . uh . . . just forgot how it looked cause . . . sometimes it looks . . . bunchy,&#x201d; I lie.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew it had to be yours! But when did you put it in the closet?&#x201d; She looks super-duper confused.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Uhhhh . . . when I was . . . was . . . going to the bathroom,&#x201d; I lie.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hmmm, okay,&#x201d; says my teacher. Then she turns her head away from me.</p><p>I walk back to my desk thinking, <i>I did it!</i> I got away from the evil coat. I imagine the coat blowing away, up to the clouds, gone forever.&nbsp;</p><p>But then Benji, who works in the cafeteria, comes into our classroom during writing time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>AND HE&#x2019;S HOLDING THE COAT!!!!!</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, kids! This coat was left in the cafe�teria. Does this belong to anyone in here? Before I take it to the lost and found . . . I mean, <i>what a good-looking coat</i>!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>My teacher&#x2019;s head turns very quickly to look at me. Now she doesn&#x2019;t look super-duper confused anymore. She looks like she&#x2019;s going crazy! &#x201c;Dory . . . I thought you just said your coat was in your backpack. Isn&#x2019;t this your coat?&#x201d; asks my teacher.</p><p>I slip down low in my chair.&nbsp;&#x201c;Nope,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you say . . . wait a minute . . . Go show me the coat in your backpack. And please ask your mom to label your coat!&#x201d;</p><p>I walk slowly to the closet.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Alrighty, kiddos, I hate to bring such a <i>snazzy coat</i> to the lost and found, but that&#x2019;s where it will be,&#x201d; says Benji.&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t know what to do when I get to the closet. I don&#x2019;t even have my backpack! I stand in the closet. Deep in a corner. How do I break this evil spell? Do you get in trouble if you tell on yourself? I wonder.</p><p>&#x201c;Rascal, come out. The teacher forgot all about you!&#x201d; It&#x2019;s George.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;How come?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because Charlie threw up in the water fountain!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He did?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And he gets to go home!&#x201d; George says.</p><p>&#x201c;No fair!&#x201d; I say. I hand Charlie his backpack since I&#x2019;m in the closet anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>When I come out of the closet, I see that George was right.&nbsp;</p><p>She definitely forgot about me!&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of the day, my mom picks me up in the school yard. She says, &#x201c;Rascal, where on earth is your coat? It&#x2019;s freezing out!&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I would really like to talk to you about that,&#x201d; says my teacher who did <i>not forget.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>I slowly walk backward away from them. Then I watch from far away. My teacher keeps talking and talking and talking. Her hands move around a lot. My mom is surprised.&nbsp;</p><p>As I watch my mom&#x2019;s face, I start crying because I know I&#x2019;m in really big trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, my mom walks over to me. &#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she says in an angry voice. &#x201c;We are going to the lost and found.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>We don&#x2019;t have to look deep in the bin, because the coat is right on top. She hands it to me and I put it on.</p><p>&#x201c;How many lies did you tell today, Rascal?&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>I try and count on my fingers. &#x201c;One . . . two . . . three . . . seven, I think. Or maybe eight?&#x201d; A hundred tears run down my face.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh boy,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;You are in really big trouble.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>Then she looks up at the sky and whispers, &#x201c;Oh, why, why, why, why?&#x201d; She takes a long breath. When she&#x2019;s done breathing, I ask her, &#x201c;Do I have to wear this coat again?&#x201d; &nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says.</p><p>I wipe my tears and smile. I love my mom so much. I hug her leg so tight that she can&#x2019;t shake me off. My body is stuck to her leg. I think it must be the spell.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, this child,&#x201d; says my mom.</p></p><h2>Longing for the Harmonies: Themes and Variations from Modern Physics</h2><p><p><strong>"Occasionally, there comes along a popular science book that both scientists and non-scientist can read with pleasure and profit, and this is one."&#x2015;<em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p> Devoted to sharing their own delight and awe before the fundamental mysteries of the cosmos, Frank Wilczek (winner of the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics) and science writer Betsy Devine also have a serious purpose: to reveal to the lay reader how a heightened perception can respond to timeless themes of the physical universe. For example, they show that even the most exotic theories always confirm that physical laws are precisely the same throughout the universe, and they explain how we have learned that the most massive molten stars and the tiniest frozen particles are in physical harmony. In their descriptions of the workings of the half-known universe, Wilczek and Devine bring all of us face to face with the beauty of eternal order and the inevitability of rational ends and beginnings.</p><p><p><b>Frank Wilczek</b> is a theoretical physicist. He has won many awards for his contributions to physics, including the 2004 Nobel Prize, and also for his writing. He is currently Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at MIT.</p><p><b>Betsy Devine</b> writes about science and humor.</p>The title here sums up today's Big Bang scientists at sea among the theoretical dissonances and paradoxes they've tried to express in their GUTS (Grand Unified Theories), which ask the question Leibnitz posed long ago: Why is there something rather than nothing? Wilczek, physics professor at UC Santa Barbara, and his coauthor wife are only the latest but certainly among the most original writers who have tried to capture the current physics scene in a book. They sum up, in somewhat the form of "themes and variations"the authors are music loverssuch challenging problems of "quantal reality" as cosmic uniformity, interchangeability, etc. Sharply knowledgeable, they discuss the nature of light (they transform "waves" and "lumps" to a new word, laves) and run the gamut from quarks, colour (they choose the British spelling), mesons, gluons et al. to deep views on matter, antimatter and what may be the most exciting and seminal concept in the new physics: symmetry. Here they have a crack at answering Leibnitz's questionan arresting climax to a book loaded with astounding insights and riddles.

Hawes was an outspoken critic of the fashion industry and a champion of ready-to-wear styles. <i>Fashion Is Spinach,</i> her witty and astute memoir, offers an insider's critique of the fashion scene during the 1920s and '30s. <br>"I don't know when the word fashion came into being, but it was an evil day," Hawes declares. Style, she maintains, reflects an era's mood, altering only with changes in attitude and taste. Fashion, conversely, exists only to perpetuate sales. Hawes denounces the industry's predatory practices, advising readers to reject ever-changing fads in favor of comfortable, durable, flattering attire. Decades ahead of her time, she offers a fascinating and tartly observed behind-the-scenes look at the fashion industry's economics, culture, and ethics. <br></p><p><p>American clothing designer Elizabeth Hawes (1903&#x2013;71) was an outspoken critic of the fashion industry and champion of ready-to-wear styles.

There are more than 300 million copies of his books in print worldwide.<i>Chapter One</i><br>MY BROTHER, ORRIN Sackett, was big enough to fight bears with a switch. Me, I was the skinny one, tall as Orrin, but no meat to my bones except around the shoulders and arms. Orrin could sing like an angel, or like a true Welshman which was better than any angel. Far away back and on three sides of the family, we were Welsh. Orrin was a strapping big man, but for such a big man he was surprising quick.<br><br>Folks said I was the quiet one, and in the high-up hills where we grew up as boys, folks fought shy of me come fighting time. Orrin was bigger than me, fit to wrassle a bull, but he lacked a streak of something I had.<br><br>Maybe you recall the Sackett-Higgins feud? Time I tell about, we Sacketts were just fresh out of Higginses.<br><br>Long Higgins, the mean one, was also the last one. He came hunting Sackett hide with an old squirrel rifle. It was Orrin he was hunting, being mighty brave because he knew Orrin wouldn't be packing anything in the way of sidearms at a wedding.<br><br>Orrin was doing no thinking about Higginses this day with Mary Tripp there to greet him and his mind set on marrying, so I figured it was my place to meet Long Higgins down there in the road. Just as I was fixing to call him to a stand, Preacher Myrick drove his rig between us, and by the time I got around it Long Higgins was standing spraddlelegged in the road with a bead on Orrin.<br><br>Folks started to scream and Long Higgins shot and Mary who saw him first pushed Orrin to save him. Only she fell off balance and fell right into the bullet intended for Orrin.<br><br>"Long!"<br><br>He turned sharp around, knowing my voice, and he had that rifle waist-high and aimed for me, his lips drawed down hard.<br><br>Long Higgins was a good hip shot with a rifle and he shot quick . . . maybe too quick.<br><br>That old hog-leg of mine went back into the holster and Long Higgins lay there in the dust and when I turned around, that walk up into the trees was the longest I ever did take except one I took a long time later.<br><br>Ollie Shaddock might have been down there and I knew if Ollie called I'd have to turn around, for Ollie was the Law in those mountains and away back somewheres we were kin.<br><br>When Ma saw me cutting up through the woods she knew something was cross-ways. Took me only a minute to tell her. She sat in that old rocker and looked me right in the eye while I told it. "Tye," she was almighty stern, "was Long Higgins looking at you when you fetched him?"<br><br>"Right in the eye."<br><br>"Take the dapple," Ma said, "he's the runningest horse on the mountain. You go west, and when you find a place with deep, rich soil and a mite of game in the hills, you get somebody to write a letter and we'll come down there, the boys an' me."<br><br>She looked around at the place, which was mighty rundown. Work as we would, and us Sacketts were workers, we still hadn't anything extra, and scarcely a poor living, so Ma had been talking up the west ever since Pa died.<br><br>Most of it she got from Pa, for he was a wandering and a knowing man, never to home long, but Ma loved him for all of that, and so did we younguns. He had a Welshman's tongue, Pa did, a tongue that could twist a fine sound from a word and he could bring a singing to your blood so you could just see that far land yonder, waiting for folks to come and crop it.<br><br>Those old blue eyes of Ma's were harder to face than was Long Higgins, and him with a gun to hand. "Tye, do you reckon you could kill Ollie?"<br><br>To nobody else would I have said it, but to Ma I told the truth. "I'd never want to, Ma, because we're kin but I could fetch him. I think maybe I can draw a gun faster and shoot straighter than anybody, anywhere."<br><br>She took the pipe from her lips. "Eighteen years now I've seen you growing up, Tyrel Sackett, and for twelve of them you've been drawing and shooting. Pa told me when you was fifteen that he'd never seen the like. Ride with the law, Tye, never against it." She drew the shawl tighter about her knees. "If the Lord wills we will meet again in the western lands."<br><br>The way I took led across the state line and south, then west. Ollie Shaddock would not follow beyond the line of the state, so I put Tennessee behind me before the hills had a shadow.<br><br>It was wild land through which the trail led, west out of Tennessee, into Arkansas, the Ozarks, and by lonely trails into Kansas. When I rode at last into the street at Baxter Springs folks figured me for one more mountain renegade coming to help keep tick-infected Texas cattle out of the country, but I was of no such mind.<br><br>It was eight miles to where the Texas men held their cattle, so there I rode, expecting no warm welcome for a stranger. Riding clear of the circling riders I rode up to the fire, the smell of grub turning my insides over. Two days I'd been without eating, with no money left, and too proud to ask for that for which I could not pay.<br><br>A short, square man with a square face and a mustache called out to me. "You there! On the gray! What do you want?"<br><br>"A job if one's to be had, and a meal if you've grub to spare. My name is Tyrel Sackett and I'm bound westward from Tennessee toward the Rockies, but if there's a job I'll ride straight up to it."<br><br>He looked me over, mighty sharp, and then he said, "Get down, man, and come to the fire. No man was ever turned from my fire without a meal inside him. I'm Belden."<br><br>When I'd tied Dapple I walked up to the fire, and there was a big, handsome man lying on the ground by the fire, a man with a golden beard like one of those Vikings Pa used to tell of. "Hell," he said agreeably, "it's a farmer!"<br><br>"What's wrong with farming?" I asked him. "You wouldn't have your belly full of beans right now if they'd not been farmed by somebody."<br><br>"We've had our troubles with farmers, Mr. Sackett," Belden said, "there's been shooting, the farmers killed a man for me."<br><br>"So," said a voice alongside, "so maybe we should kill a farmer."<br><br>He had an itch for trouble and his kind I'd met before. He was a medium-tall man with a low hanging shoulder on his gun side. His black brows met over his nose and his face was thin and narrow. If it was trouble he was hunting he was following the right trail to get it.<br><br>"Mister," I told him, "any time you think you can kill this farmer, you just have at it."<br><br>He looked across the fire at me, surprised I think, because he had expected fear. My clothes showed I was from the hills, a patched, old homespun shirt, jeans stuffed into clumsy boots. It was sure that I looked like nothing at all, only if a man looked at the pistol I wore he could see there'd been a sight of lead shot out of that barrel.<br><br>"That's enough, Carney!" Mr. Belden said sharply. "This man is a guest at our fire!"<br><br>The cook brought me a plate of grub and it smelled so good I didn't even look up until I'd emptied that plate and another, and swallowed three cups of hot black coffee. Up in the hills we like our coffee strong but this here would make bobwire grow on a man's chest in the place of hair.<br><br>The man with the golden beard watched me and he said to Mr. Belden, "Boss, you better hire this man. If he can work like he can eat, you've got yourself a hand."<br><br>"Question is," Carney broke in, "can he fight?"<br><br>It was mighty quiet around that fire when I put my plate aside and got up. "Mister, I didn't kill you before because when I left home I promised Ma I'd go careful with a gun, but you're a mighty tryin' man."<br><br>Carney had the itch, all right, and as he looked across the fire at me I knew that sooner or later I was going to have to kill this man.<br><br>"You promised Ma, did you?" he scoffed. "We'll see about that!" He brought his right foot forward about an inch and I durned near laughed at him, but then from behind me came a warm, rich voice and it spoke clear and plain. "Mister, you just back up an' set down. I ain't aimin' to let Tyrel hang up your hide right now, so you just set down an' cool off."<br><br>It was Orrin, and knowing Orrin I knew his rifle covered Carney.<br><br>"Thanks, Orrin. Ma made me promise to go careful."<br><br>"She told me . . . an' lucky for this gent."<br><br>He stepped down from the saddle, a fine, big, handsome man with shoulders wide enough for two strong men. He wore a belt gun, too, and I knew he could use it.<br><br>"Are you two brothers?" Belden asked.<br><br>"Brothers from the hills," Orrin said, "bound west for the new lands."<br><br>"You're hired," Mr. Belden said, "I like men who work together."<br><br>So that was how it began, but more had begun that day than any of us could guess, least of all the fine-looking man with the beard who was Tom Sunday, our foreman on the drive. From the moment he had spoken up all our lives were pointed down a trail together, but no man could read the sign.<br><br>From the first Orrin was a well-loved man. With that big, easy way of his, a wide smile, as well as courage and humor enough for three men, he was a man to ride the trail with. He did his share of the work and more, and at night around the fire he would sing or tell yarns. When he sang to the cows in that fine Welsh baritone of his, everybody listened.<br><br>Nobody paid me much mind. Right off they saw I could do my work and they let me do it. When Orrin told them I was the tough one of the two they just laughed. Only there was one or two of them who didn't laugh and of these one was Tom Sunday, the other Cap Rountree, a thin, wiry old man with a walrus mustache who looked to have ridden a lot of trails.<br><br>The third day out, Tom Sunday fetched up alongside me and asked, "Tye, what would you have done if Reed Carney had grabbed his gun?"<br><br>"Why, Mr. Sunday," I said, "I'd have killed him."<br><br>He glanced at me. "Yes, I expect you would have."<br><br>He swung off then, only turned in his saddle. "Call me Tom. I'm not much on long-handled names."<br>Have you seen those Kansas plains? Have you seen the grass stretch away from you to the horizon? Grass and nothing but grass except for flowers here and there and maybe the white of buffalo bones, but grass moving gentle under the long wind, moving like a restless sea with the hand of God upon it.<br><br>On the fifth day when I was riding point by myself, and well out from the herd a dozen men came riding out of a ravine, all bunched up. Right off I had a smell of trouble, so instead of waiting for them to come up, I rode right to meet them.<br><br>It was a mighty pleasant day and the air was balmy with summer. Overhead the sky was blue and only a mite of cloud drifting like a lost white buffalo over the plain of the sky.<br><br>When they were close I drew up and waited, my Spencer .56 cradled on my saddle, my right hand over the trigger guard.<br><br>They drew up, a dirty, rough-looking bunch&#x2014;their leader mean enough to sour cream.<br><br>"We're cuttin' your herd," he was a mighty abrupt man, "we're cuttin' it now. You come through the settlements an' swept up a lot of our cattle, an' they've et our grass."<br><br>Well, I looked at him and I said, "I reckon not."<br><br>Sort of aimlesslike I'd switched that Spencer to cover his belt buckle, my right finger on the trigger.<br><br>"Look here, boy," he started in to bluster.<br><br>"Mister," I said, "this here Spencer ain't no boy, an' I'm just after makin' a bet with a fellow. He says one of those big belt buckles like you got would stop a bullet. Me, I figure a chunk of lead, .56 caliber, would drive that buckle right back into your belly. Mister, if you want to be a sport we can settle that bet."<br><br>He was white around the eyes, and if one of the others made a wrong move I was going to drop the bull of the herd and as many others as time would allow.<br><br>"Back," it was one of the men behind the leader, "I know this boy. This here is one of them Sacketts I been tellin' you about."<br><br>It was one of those no-account Aikens from Turkey Flat, who'd been run out of the mountains for hog stealing.<br><br>"Oh?"

That there's just what we figured to do."<br><br>They turned tail around and rode off and a couple of minutes later hoofs drummed on the sod and here came Mr. Belden, Tom Sunday, Cap Rountree, and Reed Carney, all a-sweat an' expecting trouble.

Kneeing Dapple around I started back to the herd.<br><br>"Now what do you make of that?" I could hear Belden saying. "I'd have sworn that was Back Rand."<br><br>"It was," Rountree commented dryly, "but that there's quite a boy."<br><br>When Orrin asked me about it at the fire that night, I just said, "Aiken was there.

Who's Aiken?"<br><br>"He's from the mountains," Orrin said, "he knows the kid."<br><br>Reed Carney said nothing more but a couple of times I noticed him sizing me up like he hadn't seen me before.<br><br>There would be trouble enough, but man is born to trouble, and it is best to meet it when it comes and not lose sleep until it does. Only there was more than trouble, for beyond the long grass plains were the mountains, the high and lonely mountains where someday I would ride, and where someday, the Good Lord willing, I would find a home.<br><br>How many trails?

Although none of Mollino&#x2019;s designs were mass-produced, they command high prices among collectors of twentieth-century furniture and are part of the collections of major design museums. Others recall Mollino for his large secret stash of erotic Polaroids, taken throughout the 1960s and recovered among his personal effects after his death. The risqu� photos have been the subject of several exhibitions and have inspired fashion designers, including Jeremy Scott, who drew on them when creating a recent collection for Moschino. Much less attention has been devoted to Mollino&#x2019;s contribution to architecture.<br><br> With <i>Carlo Mollino: Architect and Storyteller</i>, Napoleone Ferrari and Michelangelo Sabatino offer the first carefully researched and comprehensive study of Mollino&#x2019;s architectural work. Drawing on rich archival materials, as well as Mollino&#x2019;s own writings, they argue persuasively that, while Mollino realized relatively few projects, his contributions to architecture&#x2014;and, in particular, the modernist movement&#x2014;are both significant and distinctive due to Mollino&#x2019;s strong affinity with surrealism. The book features both built and unrealized projects, including masterpieces like the Teatro Regio and the Torino Chamber of Commerce and early, lesser-known works like the Torino Horse Riding Club and the Lago Negro chairlift station in the Italian Alps. Lavish illustrations and essays by Ferrari and Sabatino round out this overdue tribute to an extraordinary personality of twentieth-century architecture.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Napoleone Ferrari</b> is an author and editor and director of Museo Casa Mollino in Torino. <b>Michelangelo Sabatino&nbsp;</b>is a Chicago-based architect and historian.

From growing your own vegetables to canceling your credit cards to reading Jean-Paul Sartre, here are excellent suggestions for nourishing mind, body, and spirit&#x2014;witty, provocative, sometimes outrageous, yet eminently sage advice for breaking with convention and living an uncluttered, unfettered, and therefore happier, life. </p></p><p><p>Tom Hodgkinson is still doing what he's always done, which is a mixture of editing magazines, writing articles, and putting on parties. He was born in 1968, founded <em>The Idler</em> in 1993, and now lives in Devon, England. He is also the author of <em>The Freedom Manifesto</em>.</p>In this intermittently amusing but excessively long sequel to <i>How to Be Idle: A Loafer's Manifesto</i>, British author and editor (the <i>Idler</i>) Hodgkinson states upfront that his goal is to present a philosophy for everyday life based on freedom, merriment and responsibility, or anarchy. Asserting that before the Reformation, England was one non-stop party, he wants to overthrow modern Puritans and return to an approach to life that is basically having a laugh, doing what you want&#x2014;and he provides alternatives to the many ills of the modern world such as those listed in the book's title. The main problem is that many of Hodgkinson's topics end up being played for easy laughs&#x2014;in one chapter titled Forget Government, the message is Stop Voting, while in another on Submit No More to the Machine, Use Your Hands, his main advice is Use a Scythe. When he does try to move beyond laughs and explain how his philosophy can cause a radical redefinition of human relationships based on local needs instead of global capitalism, he never quite explores how this would happen in the real world, relying instead on grand statements (in a chapter called Stop Working, Start Living) such as A spade, a saw and a chisel, that is all you need to be free. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I used to wonder why, but I don&#x2019;t anymore. There are some differences that reveal rifts so deep that dialogue breaks down. Among these are the current debates that have been raging between God-believers and the so-called new atheists. It often seems that people on one side can&#x2019;t begin to grasp what the world is like, what it feels like, for those on the other side. When the person with whom one is conversing appears utterly opaque, then mistrust and contempt are easily aroused: How can he be saying that when the opposite seems so obvious to me? Is he stupid, dishonest, maybe just a touch evil? These are not the sort of suspicions that the gracious hostess wants intruding at her candle-lit dinner table.</p> <p>But for me, as a novelist, it&#x2019;s differences like these, indicating entirely different orientations toward the world, which are the most tantalizing to explore. Arguments alone can&#x2019;t capture all that is at stake for people when they argue about issues of reason and faith. In the end, I place my faith in fiction, in its power to make vividly present how different the world feels to each of us and how these differences are sometimes what is really being expressed in the great debates of our day on the existence of God.</p> <p>The title of the book is <em>36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</em>.

Michael L. Satlow offers a fresh perspective on Judaism that recognizes both its similarities and its immense diversity. Presenting snapshots of Judaism from around the globe and throughout history, Satlow explores the links between vastly different communities and their Jewish traditions. He studies the geonim, rabbinical scholars who lived in Iraq from the ninth to twelfth centuries; the intellectual flourishing of Jews in medieval Spain; how the Hasidim of nineteenth-century Eastern Europe confronted modernity; and the post-World War II development of distinct American and Israeli Jewish identities. Satlow pays close attention to how communities define themselves, their relationship to biblical and rabbinic texts, and their ritual practices. His fascinating portraits reveal the amazingly creative ways Jews have adapted over time to social and political challenges and continue to remain a &#34;Jewish family.&#34;</p><p><p>Michael L.

Now comes Red Cloud's autobiography. Editor Paul, the historian of the Nebraska State Historical Society, recounts the strange twists of fate that overtook this document. In 1893, Red Cloud was encouraged to give an account of his life, which was then recorded by others. The manuscript was given to Addison Sheldon, then director of the Nebraska State Historical Society, who did nothing with it except have it copied in 1932 by his assistant, Mari Sandoz. Because of its obscure background, its ending in the early 1860s, and the negative images of Red Cloud (Sandoz, for instance, cast him as a villain in her Crazy Horse, published in 1942), the manuscript continued to languish. The autobiography is an exciting glimpse of the life of the Plains Indians before their defeat and removal to reservation life. Worthy reading for both scholarly and lay readers.?Charles V.

In prerevolutionary Russia she was a literary star, known for her humorous satirical pieces; in the 1920s and 30s, she wrote some of her finest stories in exile in Paris, recalling her unforgettable encounters with Rasputin, and her hopeful visit at age thirteen to Tolstoy after reading <i>War and Peace</i>. In this selection of her best autobiographical stories, she covers a wide range of subjects, from family life to revolution and emigration, writers and writing.<br> &nbsp;<br> Like Nabokov, Platonov, and other great Russian prose writers, Teffi was a poet who turned to prose but continued to write with a poet&#x2019;s sensitivity to tone and rhythm. Like Chekhov, she fuses wit, tragedy, and a remarkable capacity for observation; there are few human weaknesses she did not relate to with compassion and understanding.</p><p><b>Teffi</b> (1872&#x2013;1952) was a popular writer in prerevolutionary Russia, a favorite of both Tsar Nicholas II and Lenin. She was born to a prominent St. Petersburg family and emigrated from Bolshevik Russia in 1919. Eventually settling in Paris, she became an important figure in the �migr� literary scene and lived there until her death. <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Robert Chandler</b> is the translator of the NYRB Classics editions of Andrey Platanov&#x2019;s <i>Soul </i>and<i> The Foundation Pit</i>.

Read and admired by Nicholas II and Lenin, scornful of the Whites and the Bolsheviks, pursued in vain by Rasputin, constitutionally incapable of suffering fools, Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya was one of prerevolutionary Russia's brightest literary beacons.&#x201d; &#x2014;Michael Robbins,<i>&nbsp;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></i><br><br>"Nearly all her portraits &#x2013; both of &#x2018;famous historical figures&#x2019; and of ordinary people &#x2013; are sharp and vivid. There is only one person in Teffi&#x2019;s autobiographical prose who we are not really allowed to see. This is Nadezhda Lokhvitskaya, carefully concealed by her witty, observant and humane alter ego &#x2013;Teffi." &#x2014;Masha Karp, <i>The World Today<br></i><br>"Teffi&#x2019;s genius lies in applying a light, ironic and at times satirical flair of humour to deeply serious subjects. She uses this light-hearted humourous touch to appear detached from subjects which she evidently holds very deep feelings about. It&#x2019;s this combination of light, superficial levity with profound depth that makes her work so compelling...<i>The Best of Teffi</i>&nbsp;is an excellent collection, a wonderful and compelling introduction to the work of a brilliant and underappreciated writer who deserves much greater recognition in the literary world.

Taylor Grayhawk was a great pilot, but there was nothing she could do with both engines flamed out. Her hands were shaking and a knot of fear had formed in her throat. Without the rumble of engines, the Twin Otter that had just dropped seven smoke jumpers on a raging inferno in Yellowstone National Park was eerily quiet.<br><br>She took a firmer grip on the control column as a way to keep herself&#x2014;�her emotions and her mind and her body&#x2014;�calm. The terrifying threat of plummeting into the fire, along with undeniable whiffs of choking black smoke in the cockpit, made it plain she didn&#x2019;t have much time left to figure out a way to save herself and the single passenger left on the plane.<br><br>Taylor had just dropped the last jumper to fight the blaze that had been burning for the past two weeks, when a whirlwind of fire had engulfed the Otter. Without power, she&#x2019;d been slowly, but steadily, losing altitude. She turned, with eyes she hoped didn&#x2019;t reveal how frightened she was, to stare over her shoulder at the single smoke jumper remaining on the plane.<br><br>&#x201c;You can still jump,&#x201d; she said loud enough to be heard over the unnerving whisper of wind in the open doorway at the rear of the Otter.<br><br>&#x201c;Not without you,&#x201d; the jumper replied, pulling off his headset.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a parachute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We can share mine.&#x201d;<br><br>Taylor calculated the odds of getting to the ground hanging on to Brian Flynn by her fingernails&#x2014;�and whatever other body parts she could wrap around him. She wasn&#x2019;t a gambler by nature, and she didn&#x2019;t like what she saw. Brian was wearing a yellow padded jump jacket and Kevlar-�reinforced pants, which acted like a cowboy&#x2019;s chaps, to protect the firefighter&#x2019;s trousers from being ripped by brush and tree limbs. She imagined herself falling&#x2014;�sliding down his body&#x2014;�into the scorching flames below and shivered.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take my chances on getting the plane to the ground in one piece,&#x201d; she said, turning back to the control panel to see how much lift she could manage without the engines. Not much. She searched in vain for a meadow&#x2014;�any flat place, for that matter&#x2014;�where she might crash-�land the plane. The only barren terrain she saw, in one of the most remote areas in the Lower 48, were steep mountain slopes leading straight down into the ferocious fire.<br><br>The spotter, who was required to be on all flights to gauge the wind, fire activity, and terrain, hadn&#x2019;t shown up for this 9&nbsp;p.m. flight, which took advantage of the long August daylight. So Brian, already dressed in smoke-�jumping gear, had doffed his Ram Air parachute and cage helmet in the corner of the plane, donned the spotter&#x2019;s harness and helmet, and served as spotter instead. After the last smoke jumper had gone out the door, Brian had suggested that Taylor drop down to survey the fire perimeter, in order to send the latest information back to base.<br><br>It was a judgment call whether the risk was worth the reward. But this fire had been frighteningly unpredictable, and she understood Brian&#x2019;s concern for the safety of his fellow smoke jumpers. It hadn&#x2019;t been easy to see anything through the cloud of black smoke, so she&#x2019;d slipped even lower&#x2014;�and been engulfed in a sudden tornado of flame, rising hundreds of feet from the 250-�foot conifers below.<br><br>They&#x2019;d been drifting downward ever since.<br><br>Brian met her gaze with worried eyes. &#x201c;This plane&#x2019;s headed straight into the fire,&#x201d; he said from the open doorway. &#x201c;We need to jump now, while there&#x2019;s still time to hit a safe clearing. Get over here, Tag. Move your butt!&#x201d;<br><br>The use of her nickname, which came from her initials&#x2014;�Taylor Ann Grayhawk&#x2014;�conjured powerful, pain�ful memories. Brian had dubbed her with it when he was a junior and she was a freshman at Jackson High.<br><br>Taylor felt her stomach shift when the plane jolted, as the right wingtip was abruptly shoved upward by a scorching gust of air. Time was running out. Her eyes were tearing from the smoke, and her chin was trembling, despite her clenched teeth. In a voice that was hoarse, but surprisingly composed, considering the desperation she felt inside, Taylor reported their position on the radio, along with the information she&#x2019;d gleaned from their survey of the fire and the fact that she&#x2019;d been unable to restart the engines.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m putting us down in the first clearing I find,&#x201d; she told the dispatcher.<br><br>&#x201c;Roger,&#x201d; the dispatcher replied. &#x201c;Good luck.&#x201d;<br><br>As Taylor surveyed the violent landscape, she figured it was going to take more than luck to survive. It was going to take a miracle. She didn&#x2019;t see an area large enough to allow her to land without going in nose first. If the crash didn&#x2019;t kill them, they would burn to death in the converging fire.<br><br>She knew her thoughts should be focused on wind currents and lift and drag. What consumed her instead was her greatest regret: What would my life be like now, if I hadn&#x2019;t broken up with Brian Flynn in high school?<br><br>Taylor had memories of the few autumn months she&#x2019;d secretly dated Brian that were hard to forget. Laughter. Loving. Sharing and bonding. He&#x2019;d seemed almost as perceptive of her feelings as her fraternal twin, which was saying something, because her life and Vick&#x2019;s had been wrapped, one around the other, like clinging vines.<br><br>It was easy to blame the tensions between their feuding families for driving them apart. Vick had been appalled when she discovered Taylor was dating one of &#x201c;those awful Flynn boys&#x201d; and demanded she stop seeing Brian. But ultimately, the decision had been hers. She was the one who&#x2019;d given up on the possibility of loving and being loved. She was the one who&#x2019;d walked away.<br><br>After college, Brian had become a firefighter and married someone else. She&#x2019;d become a corporate jet pilot who flew CEOs to meetings around the country and found time during the summer to drop smoke jumpers from a twin-�engine Otter. She&#x2019;d been engaged three times, but she&#x2019;d never married.<br><br>Since Brian&#x2019;s divorce a year ago, they were both single. During that year she&#x2019;d done nothing to engage his interest, nothing to reignite the secret romance-�of-�a-�lifetime that had been snuffed out thirteen years ago, like a campfire you were done with.<br><br>She&#x2019;d often thought about approaching Brian once she learned he was free.

The culminating factor has been her mother's death, and now Maya embarks on a trek in the Himalayas, intending to sprinkle her mother's ashes at the base of Mt. Everest and finally lay to rest her tumultuous past. At rest stops in tiny Tibetan villages, she reads diary pages her lover Johanna has tucked into her bag&#x2014;the diary Johanna kept throughout their shared youth during the Vietnam era.In vivid flashbacks to those radical days, we accompany the young Maya as she awakens to the summer of love, joins the anti-war movement, and enters into a relationship with the abusive, alcoholic Rio. She finally gathers the strength to break free and seek her own true path, which takes her from the streets of Manhattan to the mountains of Mexico. Eventually she emerges, stronger and wiser, infused with the wisdom of the earth and the spirit of the goddess. Traveling through the landscape of memories helps Maya reclaim her past and foreshadows the miraculous events readers of <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing</i> know her to be capable of in the future.</p><p>The word mercury conjures many images--the messenger god, the planet that rules over communication, the liquid metal that defies attempts to be held--images that form the backbone of <i>Walking to Mercury</i>, a story chronicling the early life of Maya Greenwood. Readers familiar with Starhawk's fiction may remember Maya as the 21st-century rebel leader who was introduced in <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing </i>. In <i>Walking to Mercury</i>, a younger Maya treks through Nepal carrying the ashes of her mother on her back as she searches for a reunion with her sister. Along the way, she finds messages (through the pages of her best friend Johanna's diary, in letters from her former lover Rio, and in notes from her elusive sister) that raise spiritual mountains rivaling the peaks of the Himalayas. She struggles with her past and hopes to find out why the power that once pounded through her like a drumbeat has fallen silent. However, like the metal mercury, the answer to her troubles continually slips through her fingers. While eco-feminism plays a supporting role, the star of <i>Walking to Mercury</i> is everything that Starhawk has to tell us about being human. As Maya discovers, no matter how independent one is, one's life is inextricably entangled with the lives of others--parents, siblings, friends, lovers, and even strangers who nudge us in one direction or another (sometimes imperceptibly) despite our best attempts at isolation. Starhawk permeates every step of Maya's journey with emotion, and pulls no punches, hitting us with everything from grief to ecstasy. There is no padding to separate us from the story, but <i>Walking to Mercury</i> is no stark, utilitarian piece of minimalist fiction. This is life, with all its bitterness and all its magic. <i>--Brian Patterson</i>Critical acclaim for <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing:</i><p>"Slated to be one of the great visionary Utopian novels of the century...It's a rare book to which I give such a high recommendation; but I spent the best part of three days reading it, and at the end, I would have loved it to be longer. I simply fell in love with both characters and setting. It's a wonderful book."<br>--Marion Zimmer Bradley, author of <i>The Forest House</i></p><p>"For the future of our kind, <i>The Fifth Sacred Thing</i> is an anthem of hope. Generations to come will bless the name of Starhawk."<br>--Daniel Quinn, author of <i>Ishmael</i> and <i>The Story of B</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Enneagram Companions: Growing in Relationships and Spiritual Direction</h2><p>Zuercher breaks new ground for the uses and potential of the enneagram in understanding the centered life.

From using alternating current to light up the Chicago World&#x2019;s Fair to harnessing Niagara to electrify New York City and beyond, Nikola Tesla was a revolutionary ahead of his time.

The untold story from inside his family. Dramatic, unyielding, and provocative, Uncle Al Capone by Deirdre Marie Capone, Al Capone&#39;s grandniece, is a fascinating memoir and engaging biography. This moving, highly readable portrait of the Capone family and its mob trade examines what it has meant to survive the storied legacy of the family&#39;s forbearers. As Capone traces the arc of regret and what fuels the Capone myth, she finds redemption and a way to coexist with her legacy. In seventeen chapters with titles like &#34;The Making of the Mafioso,&#34; &#34;Trading the Chicago Outfit for the Chicago Cubs,&#34; and &#34;The Saint Valentine&#39;s Day Truth,&#34; Capone outlines organized crime in Chicago and offers vignettes of American history during the early and mid-twentieth century. Using years of research and exhaustive interviews with her aunts, uncles, and cousins, she weaves an engaging anecdotal narrative of what it meant to be a Capone, what it meant to lose her father to suicide, and what it meant to have a mother who lived in constant fear. She offers compelling evidence that Al Capone was specifically targeted for prosecution by law enforcement agencies assisted by the media, which made gross exaggerations of her uncle&#39;s exploits and fueled a phenomenon of half-truths and utter falsehoods. From the family&#39;s roots in Angri, Italy to the author&#39;s ongoing investigations today, this debut offers a comprehensive and moving portrait of an iconic American family and one woman&#39;s efforts to make peace with the past.</p><p>Gangster Al Capone once commented that &#x201c;This American system of ours...gives each and every one of us a great opportunity if we only seize it with both hands and make the most of it.&#x201d; Despite the fact that it&#x2019;s coming from a known gangster, it says a great deal about the mind of the man. He sees himself as an average, successful American businessman, even if his comment understates the whole picture. It&#x2019;s this human quality that Deirdre Marie Capone evokes in Uncle Al Capone, a fascinating book that&#x2019;s one part biography, one part memoir, and one part remembrance of Public Enemy Number One. As the grand-niece of Al, Capone recounts how she hid her family name for years. When a school research project leads her to come clean to her kids, she begins recalling the rich family history she once knew. It&#x2019;s a tale that starts after the family emigrates from Angri, Italy to Brooklyn, New York. Capone shows that Al and her grandfather, Ralph, weren&#x2019;t always members of a crime syndicate. In fact, their childhood is fairly normal, with Al finishing high school, and Ralph working odd jobs to help support the family. Everything changes when their father dies and Prohibition becomes law. Forced to earn a living for his family, Al, and eventually Ralph, head to Chicago and down the path to criminal celebrity. Throughout the book, Capone tries to reconcile what she knows about her family with recorded history. Early in the book she writes, &#x201c;I will not pretend to be able to paint a rosy picture of my uncle Al. I cannot make him out to be a perfect man, or even a good man. But what I want people to know is that he was a complex man. He was human and he had a heart.&#x201d; Capone succeeds, balancing both the public history of Al, from the Valentine&#x2019;s Day Massacre to his incarceration at Alcatraz, with personal photos, family recipes, and her own memories. The author recalls how loving certain members of the Capone family were, particularly her great-aunt Maffie who helps the author to see good in the men. It&#x2019;s not always an easy task as the author recounts losing friends, jobs, and other opportunities, once people learned she was a descendant of the notorious Al Capone. Overall, Uncle Al Capone is a memoir that is as complex and human as the man that it&#x2019;s about. It brings a fresh perspective to the other Al Capone biographies, and finally gives the larger-than-life gangster the one thing that may have eluded him in life: to be seen as simply a human being. Katerie PriorIn &#34;Uncle Al Capone&#34;, I will take you where few people were ever allowed to go: past the bodyguards and inside the Capone home at 7244 S.

Giant footprints left in the geological bedrock, tens of thousands of years old, have been discovered in India, China, and the war-torn lands of Syria. Giant bones and full skeletons have been found in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Yet despite mounting evidence, mainstream science continues to consign these findings to the fringe. <br><br>Examining global myths, historical records, megalithic ruins, and archaeological findings, Xaviant Haze provides compelling evidence for a lost race of giants in Earth&#x2019;s prehistory. He explores myths that go back thousands of years, including those found in the world&#x2019;s holiest scriptures, as well as medieval and modern myths, such as Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x2019;s account of the first kings of Britain and the stories of giant bones unearthed by Allied soldiers during World War II. He investigates historical reports of ancient giants found in Ireland and the British Isles&#x2014;the remains of which mysteriously disappeared shortly after their discovery. He explores the legends of giants in Russia and goes deep into the Far East, revealing the multitude of fascinating giant legends in China. Haze explains how giants were responsible for the megalithic wonders of Malta and how the early settlers of Australia discovered the remains of giants but these findings were suppressed by the Royal Academies. He also explores the mythic origins of the giants: Were they the hybrid results from genetic experiments of ancient aliens or from the interbreeding of the fallen angels with the daughters of man? <br><br>Covering legends and finds from throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East, Haze also presents--in its entirety--<i>The Book of Giants</i>, a portion of the Dead Sea Scrolls suppressed due to its overwhelming support for the existence of giants in antiquity.</p><p>Xaviant Haze is a researcher of ancient manuscripts and alternative history, exploring and documenting his findings on lost cities and the myths of the pre-diluvian world. The coauthor of <i>The Suppressed History of America,</i> he lives in South Beach, Florida.<b>Chapter 9 <br><br>Ancient Giants of Australia and New Zealand</b> <br><br>The lands down under hold vast resources of lost, forgotten, and mostly overlooked ancient history. The aborigine tribes speak of alien visitors, lost cultures, mysterious monsters, and of course ancient giants. In the 1875 edition of the Timaru Herald, we can read about some of these ancient Australian giants: <br><br>A very large skeleton was found yesterday, about 7 feet below the surface of the sand on the Saltwater Creek spit. Mr. Bullock, the carter [cart driver], in removing some sand for building purposes, dropped across this relic of a past age and brought the fragments to town. We have had an opportunity of inspecting them and were struck by their symmetry no less than their great size.(1) <br><br>The skull of this giant was supposedly big enough to hold the skull of a normal human just in its mouth alone. According to local Maori legend these giants were known as the Te Kahui Tipua and had perished in a great flood ages ago. Most of the discovered giant bones were found in New Zealand around the vicinity of the city of Timaru. Numerous reports of these giant skeletons of the Te Kahui Tipua were found up into the twentieth century, however, like in most cases, the bones have all gone missing, and all we are left with are the initial reports of their discovery, like the giant bones found in a cave near Port Waikato. Kept alive by an article in N.Z.Truth dated September 29, 1965, (2) this pair of giant Maori skeletons has also mysteriously vanished. <br><br>In New South Wales, the fossil of an Australian giant was discovered near Bathurst, alongside huge stone tools and hand-axes of tremendous weight and size. The fossicker that discovered the ancient haul believed the bones belonged to somebody that could have been up to twelve feet tall. This discovery reaffirms the aborigines&#x2019; beliefs that there once existed on the Australian continent a giant race of tool-wielding hominids who preceded them by thousands of years. <br><br>According to indigenous Australian beliefs, the Giants of the Dreamtime were a race of giant hominids that roamed the Australia continent long before the appearance of the first Aborigines. Australia is also home to 20,000-year-old human footprints and just recently Cretaceous dinosaur tracks were found on Broome&#x2019;s Cable beach in Western Australia. As for the ancient Australian giants they are survived by their massive stone tools, giant molars, and in the monstrous footprints they left fossilized into the rocks of down under. <br><br>French sailors discovered a tribe of &#x201c;formidable giants&#x201d; on Shark Bay in Western Australia in 1803. Historian Shino Konishi recounts the French sailors&#x2019; terrifying encounter with the giants thanks to the ship&#x2019;s zoologist and chronicler Fran�ois P�ron who documented the odd encounter. Konishi writes, &#x201c;These giants (there were a hundred or more) carried great shields and enormous spears; long, black beards grew down to the middle of their chests; they ran like furies along the beach, brandishing their weapons; they uttered great, long cries and threatened [the] fishermen, who fled precipitately toward the ship.&#x201d; P�ron himself recalled that, &#x201c;the most ancient chronicles that we possess concerning this part of New Holland [or &#x201c;Australia&#x201d; as we tend to call it these days] portray it as inhabited by a race of formidable giants.&#x201d;(3) <br><br>The Solomon Islands, an island archipelago near Papa New Guinea in the South Pacific, has an interesting history of giants as well with astonishing tales both ancient and modern. According to local reports, and the research of writers like Marius Boirayon and Jonathan Gray, it&#x2019;s said that giants still live inside the vast cave systems running underneath the rainforest mountain ranges of Guadalcanal. Could these accounts of modern giants be true? The mountain ranges of Guadalcanal have been attracting prospectors since the 1970s when gold was first discovered there. By the late &#x2019;90s the Ross Mining Company had a monopoly over the local gold-digging business and were in the process of bulldozing an area in northern Guadalcanal when one of their huge bulldozers broke down. Leaving the ten-ton blade behind, the workers hauled the bulldozer back to the workshop and promptly called it a night. The next morning when bulldozer and crew returned to the site they were astonished to find that the ten-ton blade had vanished! Everyone on the team was in disbelief. How could such a heavy object vanish without a trace? A search party for the blade was soon organized and after about twenty minutes one of the workers discovered a trail of giant human footprints leading up to a small hill with a cave entrance opening. The footprints ended near the base of a cave and the mammoth blade was discovered discarded about a hundred feet away. These were the same living giants that former Guadalcanal Premier and Finance Minister, Victor Ngele, fatefully encountered during a scouting expedition on Gold Ridge. But bad weather and a slippery road left their Toyota Hilux 4WD truck bogged down off the road in the mud. With their vehicle unmovable and stuck, Ngele and his companions made the trek back to the nearest village for help. When they returned they were surprised to find their Toyota back on the road, but even more shocked to see two giant fifteen-feet-tall men standing on each end of the muddied truck. In fear, everyone scrambled away from the Toyota with the giants dashing into the forest and Ngele and his crew returning the way they came. About a half hour later after summoning the courage to return to the site, Ngele examined the giant footprints and determined that the two giants had picked up the truck and placed it safely back on the road.</p><h2>The Christmas Heirloom: Four Holiday Novellas of Love through the Generations</h2><p>In Kristi Ann Hunter's "Legacy of Love," Sarah Gooding never suspected returning a brooch to an elderly woman would lead to a job . . . and introduce her to the woman's grandson, a man far above her station.<br><br>In Karen Witemeyer's "Gift of the Heart," widow Ruth Albright uses the family brooch as collateral for a loan from the local banker.

Papa Spork was not a natural golfer. Among other differences, natural golfers do not acquire their socks by hijacking a lorryload destined for St. Andrews. It isn&#x2019;t done. Golf is a religion of patience. Socks come and socks go, and the wise golfer waits, sees the pair he wants, and buys it without fuss. The notion that he might put a Thompson sub-machine gun in the face of the burly Glaswegian driver, and tell him to quit the cab or adorn it . . . well. A man who does that is never going to get his handicap down below the teens. <br><br> The upside is that Joe doesn&#x2019;t think of these socks as belonging to Papa Spork. They&#x2019;re just one of two thousand pairs he inherited when his father passed on to the great bunker in the sky, contents of a lock-up off Brick Lane. He returned as much of the swag as he could&#x2014;it was a weird, motley collection, very appropriate to Papa Spork&#x2019;s somewhat eccentric life of crime&#x2014;and found himself left with several suitcases of personal effects, family Bibles and albums, some bits and bobs his father apparently stole from <i>his</i> father, and a few pairs of socks the chairman of St. Andrews suggested he keep as a memento. <br><br> &#x201c;I appreciate it can&#x2019;t have been easy, doing this,&#x201d; the chairman said over the phone. &#x201c;Old wounds and so on.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Really, I&#x2019;m just embarrassed.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Good Lord, don&#x2019;t be. Bad enough that the sins of the fathers shall descend and all that, without feeling embarrassed about it. <i>My</i> father was in Bomber Command. Helped plan the firebombing of Dresden. Can you imagine? Pinching socks is rather benign, eh?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Dresden was during the war, of course, so I suppose they thought it had to be done. Jolly heroic, no doubt. But I&#x2019;ve seen photographs. Have you?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Try not to, I should. They&#x2019;ll stay with you. But if ever you do, for some godforsaken reason, it might make you feel better to be wearing a pair of lurid Argyles. I&#x2019;m putting a few in a parcel. If it will salve your guilt, I shall choose the absolute nastiest ones.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Oh, yes, all right. Thank you.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I fly myself, you know. Civilian. I used to love it, but recently I can&#x2019;t help but see firebombs falling. So I&#x2019;ve sort of given up. Rather a shame, really.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Yes, it is.&#x201d; <br><br> There&#x2019;s a pause while the chairman considers the possibility that he may have revealed rather more of himself than he had intended. <br><br> &#x201c;Right then. It&#x2019;ll be the chartreuse. I quite fancy a pair of those myself, to wear next time I visit the old bugger up at Hawley Churchyard. &#x2018;Look here, you frightful old sod,&#x2019; I shall tell him, &#x2018;where you persuaded yourself it was absolutely vital that we immolate a city full of civilians, other men&#x2019;s fathers restricted themselves to stealing ugly socks.&#x2019; That ought to show him, eh?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I suppose so.&#x201d; <br><br> So on his feet now are the fruits of this curious exchange, and very welcome between his unpedicured soles and the icy floor. <br><br> The leather coat, meanwhile, is a precaution against attack. He does own a dressing gown, or rather, a toweling bathrobe, but while it&#x2019;s more cosy to get into, it&#x2019;s also more vulnerable. Joe Spork inhabits a warehouse space above his workshop&#x2014;his late grandfather&#x2019;s workshop&#x2014;in a dingy, silent bit of London down by the river. The march of progress has passed it by because the views are grey and angular and the place smells strongly of riverbank, so the whole enormous building notionally belongs to him, though it is, alas, somewhat entailed to banks and lenders. Mathew&#x2014;this being the name of his lamentable dad&#x2014;had a relaxed attitude to paper debt; money was something you could always steal more of.<br><br>Speaking of debts, he wonders sometimes&#x2014;when he contemplates the high days and the dark days of his time as the heir of crime&#x2014;whether Mathew ever killed anyone. Or, indeed, whether he killed a multitude. Mobsters, after all, are given to arguing with one another in rather bloody ways, and the outcomes of these discussions are often bodies draped like wet cloth over barstools and behind the wheels of cars. Is there a secret graveyard somewhere, or a pig farm, where the consequences of his father&#x2019;s breezy amorality are left to their final rest? And if there is, what liability does his son inherit on that score? <br><br> In reality, the ground floor is entirely given over to Joe&#x2019;s workshop and saleroom. It&#x2019;s high and mysterious, with things under dust sheets and&#x2014;best of all&#x2014;wrapped in thick black plastic and taped up in the far corner &#x201c;to treat the woodworm.&#x201d; Of recent days these objects are mostly nothing more than a couple of trestles or benches arranged to look significant when buyers come by, but some are the copper-bottomed real thing&#x2014;timepieces, music boxes, and best of all: hand-made mechanical automata, painted and carved and cast when a computer was a fellow who could count without reference to his fingers. <br><br> It&#x2019;s impossible, from within, not to know where the warehouse is. The smell of old London whispers up through the damp boards of the sale room, carrying with it traces of river, silt and mulch, but by some fillip of design and aging wood it never becomes obnoxious. The light from the window slots, high above ground level and glazed with that cross-wired glass for security, falls at the moment on no fewer than five Edinburgh long-case clocks, two pianolas, and one remarkable object which is either a mechanised rocking horse or something more outr� for which Joe will have to find a rather racy sort of buyer. These grand prizes are surrounded by lesser ephemera and common-or-garden stock: crank-handle telephones, gramophones and curiosities. And there, on a plinth, is the Death Clock. <br><br> It&#x2019;s just a piece of Victorian tat, really. A looming skeleton in a cowl drives a chariot from right to left, so that&#x2014;to the western European observer, used to reading from left to right&#x2014;he is coming to meet us. He has his scythe slung conveniently across his back for easy reaping, and a scrawny steed with an evil expression pulls the thing onward, ever onward. The facing wheel is a black clock with very slender bone hands. It has no chime; the message is perhaps that time passes without punctuation, but passes all the same. Joe&#x2019;s grandfather, in his will, commended it to his heir for &#x201c;special consideration&#x201d;&#x2014;the mechanism is very clever, motivated by atmospheric fluctuation&#x2014;but the infant Joe was petrified of it, and the adolescent resented its immutable, morbid promise. Even now&#x2014;particularly now, when thirty years of age is visible in his rear-view mirror and forty glowers at him from down the road ahead, now that his skin heals a little more slowly than it used to from solder burn and nicks and pinks, and his stomach is less a washboard and more a comfy if solid bench&#x2014;Joe avoids looking at it. <br><br> The Death Clock also guards his only shameful secret, a minor, practical concession to the past and the financial necessities. In the deepest shadows of the warehouse, next to the leaky part of the wall and covered in a grimy dustsheet, are six old slot machines&#x2014;genuine one-armed bandits&#x2014;which he is refurbishing for an old acquaintance named Jorge. Jorge (&#x201c;Yooorrr-geh! With passion like Pasternak!&#x201d; he tells new acquaintances) runs a number of low dives which feature gambling and other vices as their main attractions, and Joe&#x2019;s job is to maintain these traditional machines&#x2014;which now dispense tokens for high-value amounts and intimate services rather than mere pennies&#x2014;and to bugger them systematically so that they pay out on rare occasions or according to Jorge&#x2019;s personal instruction. The price of continuity in the clockworking business is minor compromise. <br><br>The floor above&#x2014;the living area, where Joe has a bed and some old wooden wardrobes big enough to conceal a battleship&#x2014;is a beautiful space. It has broad, arched windows and mellowed red-brick walls which look out onto the river on one side, and on the other an urban landscape of stores and markets, depots and back offices, lock-ups, car dealerships, Customs pounds, and one vile square of green-grey grass which is protected by some indelible ordinance and thus must be allowed to fester where it lies. <br><br> All very fine, but the warehouse has recently acquired one serious irritant: a cat. At some time, one mooring two hundred yards up was allowed to go to a houseboat, on which lives a very sweet, very poor family called Watson. Griff and Abbie are a brace of mildly paranoid anarchists, deeply allergic to paperwork and employment on conscientious grounds. There&#x2019;s a curious courage to them both: they believe in a political reality which is utterly terrifying, and they&#x2019;re fighting it. Joe is never sure whether they&#x2019;re mad or just alarmingly and uncompromisingly incapable of self-delusion. <br><br> In any case, he gives any spare clockwork toys he has to the Watsons, and eats dinner with them once in a while to make sure they&#x2019;re still alive. They in their turn share with him vegetables from their allotment and keep an eye on the warehouse if he goes away for the weekend. The cat (Joe thinks of it as &#x2018;the Parasite&#x2019;) adopted them some months ago and now rules the houseboat by a combination of adept political and emotional pressure brought to bear through the delighted Watson children and a psychotic approach to the rodent population, which earns the approval of Mr. and Mrs. W. Sadly, the Parasite has identified the warehouse as its next home, if once it can destroy or evict the present owner, of whom it does not approve. <br><br> Joe peers into the piece of burnished brass he uses as a shaving mirror. He found it here when he took possession, a riveted panel from something bigger, and he likes the warmth of it. Glass mirrors are green, and make your image look sick and sad. He doesn&#x2019;t want to be the person he sees reflected in a glass mirror. Instead, here&#x2019;s this warm, genial bloke, a little unkempt, but&#x2014;if not wealthy&#x2014;at least healthy and fairly wise. <br><br> Joe is a big man, with wide shoulders and hips. His bones are heavy. He has a strong face, and his skull is proud beneath the skin. Passably handsome, perhaps, but not delicate. Unlike Papa Spork, who had his father&#x2019;s genes, and looked like a flamenco dancer, Joe is most unfairly designed by nature to resemble a guy who works the door at the rougher kind of bar. He gets it from his mother&#x2019;s side: Harriet Spork is a narrow creature, but that owes more to religion and meals high in fibre than it does to genetics. Her bones are the bones of a Cumbrian meat-packer and his Dorset yeoman wife. Nature intended in her design a hearty life of toil, open fires and plump old age attended by a brood of sun-touched brats. That she chose instead to be a singer and more latterly a nun is evidence of a certain submerged cussedness, or possibly a consequence of the strange upheavals of the twentieth century, which made rural motherhood look, at least for a while, like an admission of defeat. <br><br> From somewhere in the warehouse, there&#x2019;s a curiously suffused silence. A hunting silence: the Parasite, having declared war almost immediately upon making his acquaintance, enters each morning via the window that Joe props open to stop the place getting stuffy when the central heating comes on, and ascends to balance on the white, moulded frame around the kitchen door. When he passes underneath, it drops onto his shoulders, extends its claws, and slides down his back in an attempt to peel him like an apple. The leather jacket and, alas, the skin beneath&#x2014;because the first time this happened he was wearing only a pajama shirt&#x2014;carry the scars.<br><br>Today, tiring of a.m. guerilla war&#x2014;and sensitive to the possibility that while he is presently single, he may one day bring an actual woman to this place, and she may wish not to be scalped by an irate feline when she sashays off to make tea, perhaps with one of his shirts thrown around her shoulders and the hem brushing the tops of her elegant legs and revealing the narrowest sliver of buttock&#x2014;Joe has chosen to escalate the situation. Late last night, he applied a thin layer of Vaseline to the coping. He tries not to reflect on the nature of a life whose high point is an adversarial relationship with an entity possessing the same approximate reasoning and emotional alertness as a milk bottle. <br><br> Ah. That whisper is a silken tail brushing the mug tree with its friendly, mismatched china. That creak means the floorboard by the wall, that pitter-patter is the animal jumping from the dresser . . . and that remarkable, outraged sound must be the noise it makes bouncing off the far wall after sliding all along the coping, followed by . . . yes. An undignified thump as it hits the floor. Joe wanders into his kitchen. The Parasite stares at him from the corner, eyes spilling over with mutiny and hate. <br><br> &#x201c;Primate,&#x201d; Joe tells it, waggling his hands. &#x201c;Tool user. Opposable thumbs.&#x201d; <br><br> The Parasite glowers, and stalks out. <br><br> Having thus inaugurated Victory Over The Cat Day, it is in the nature of his world that Joe Spork should immediately be overtaken on the ladder of mammalian supremacy by a dog.</p><h2>Remarkable Trees of the World</h2><p><p><strong>"A stunning volume" (<em>Time</em>) and the most magnificent book on the world's trees published in years.</strong></p> The publication of <em>Remarkable Trees of the World</em> took American audiences by storm. Thomas Pakenham embarks on a five-year odyssey to most of the temperate and tropical regions of the world to photograph sixty trees of remarkable personality and presence: Dwarfs, Giants, Monuments, and Aliens; the lovingly tended midgets of Japan; the enormous strangler from India; and the 4,700-year "Old Methusalehs." American readers will be fascinated by Pakenham's first examination of North American trees, including the towering Redwoods of Sequoia and Yosemite, the gaunt Joshua Trees of Death Valley and the Bristlecone pines discovered in California's White Mountains.<br><br> Many of these trees were already famous&#x2015;champions by girth, height, volume or age&#x2015;while others had never previously been caught by the camera. Pakenham's five-year odyssey, sweating it out with a 30 pound Linhof camera and tripod, took him to most of the temperate and many of the tropical regions of the world. Although North American trees dominate this book, Pakenham also trekked to remote regions in Mexico, all over Europe, parts of Asia including Japan, northern and southern Africa, Madagascar, Australia and New Zealand.<br><br><em>Remarkable Trees of the World</em> is a lavish work that will be treasured for generations by all those who marvel at nature. Color photographs throughout</p><p>Thomas Pakenham&#39;s Meetings with Remarkable Trees received international acclaim. His other books include Remarkable Trees of the World, The Boer War and The Scramble for Africa, which won the Alan Paton Award. He lives in London.Adult/High School-Following Meetings with Remarkable Trees (Random, 1998), which features trees in Britain and Ireland, this book sets out to discover more such natural wonders elsewhere. In Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand, he finds 60 commanding giants and dwarfs, Methuselahs, shrines, and "dream" trees of many kinds. Whether he is meeting baobabs, sequoias, or banyans, he finds magnificence, beauty, and, sometimes, sadness. He has a genius for communicating his sense of each tree as an individual being, engendering wonder, awe, and respect for it in readers. His thoughtful but brisk narratives bring his travels to life and readers feel that they are participants in an adventure as he experiences trees, their ecological and historical contexts, and the challenges of creating photographs of such difficult and special subjects. And Pakenham's color photographs are truly remarkable as he conveys the tactile aspect of bark, the sense of size or majesty, or the rare moment when the light is just right to capture the spirit of the tree. Chapters are further enhanced with historical illustrations (often, earlier views of the same trees) and snippets of poetry ranging from Alfred, Lord Tennyson to Ogden Nash. Pakenham ends with a chapter on "Trees in Peril." This beautiful and unique book is sure to be appreciated by nature lovers. And though it is a highly personal work and not a scientific text, it demonstrates keen and accurate observation; it could also serve as an excellent supplement to studies in science, history, and geography.<br><i>Christine C.

The surest path to health and energy, strong bones, and beautiful skin begins with a diet rich in natural foods such as whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. Especially important on this road to health are fresh fruit and vegetable juices. Fresh juices provide vital proteins, carbohydrates, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients critical to good health in one serving.<br><br>The Surgeon General, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Cancer Institute, and many other experts have long agreed that fresh fruits and vegetables are the key to good nutrition. Juicing is the most fun and efficient way to increase your consumption of these life-giving foods as it provides the nutritional advantages of plant foods in a concentrated form that is easily absorbed by the body. <br><br>The advantages of increased energy, strengthened immunity, reduced risk of disease, strong bones, and the glowing complexion that is the evidence of great health can all be yours when fresh fruit and vegetable juices play a key role in your daily diet.<br><br>what do americans eat?<br><br>The so-called Standard American Diet, or SAD, does not provide adequate levels of fruits and vegetables. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination surveys conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Health over the past 20 years, French fries or potato chips notwithstanding, fewer than 10 percent of Americans meet the minimum recommendation of 2 fruit servings and 3 vegetable servings a day&#x2014;in fact, the average number of daily servings of dark green or orange vegetables in American adults is 0.3 servings per day.<br><br>Instead of eating foods rich in vital nutrients, most Americans focus on refined foods high in calories, sugar, fat, and cholesterol, filling up on cheeseburgers, French fries, ice cream, and chocolate chip cookies and washing them down with artificially colored and flavored fruit drinks or colas. More and more food additives (such as preservatives, artificial colors, artificial flavorings, and acidifiers) have been shown to be extremely detrimental to health. Many have been banned because they were found to cause cancer and a great number of synthetic food additives are still in use that are being linked to such diseases as depression, asthma and other allergies, hyperactivity and learning disabilities in children, and migraine headaches. Synthetic food additives need to be avoided. It is a &#x201c;SAD&#x201d; fact that diet has replaced cigarettes as the number one contributor to premature death, and that 8 out of every 10 Americans over the age of 25 are now overweight or obese. Diet and obesity contribute to heart disease, cancer, strokes, diabetes, and virtually every other major disease afflicting our society. It&#x2019;s little wonder when you take a look at what we eat.<br><br>Based on detailed national health and nutrition surveys, it has been estimated that in one year, the average American consumes 100 pounds of refined sugar and 55 pounds of fats and oils in the form of:<br><br>�300 bottles of sugary beverages<br><br>�18 pounds of candy<br><br>�5 pounds of potato chips<br><br>�7 pounds of corn chips, popcorn, and pretzels<br><br>�63 dozen doughnuts and pastries<br><br>�50 pounds of cakes and cookies<br><br>�20 gallons of ice cream<br><br>On top of this, nearly one-third of our adult population smokes and at least 10 percent are alcoholics. And what about the health effects of the more than 4 billion pounds of additives, pesticides, and herbicides added to our foods each year? It is no wonder that as a nation, according to the World Health Organization and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United States ranked lower in life expectancy than 39 other industrial nations in 2012, despite the fact that we spend more money on health care than any nation in the world.<br><br>antioxidants and the battle against free radicals<br><br>Throughout this book, many key benefits of consuming fresh juices will be pointed out, but perhaps the greatest benefit is that they provide high levels of natural plant compounds known as antioxidants, which can protect the body against aging, cancer, heart disease, and many other degenerative conditions. The cells of the human body are constantly under attack. The culprits? Compounds known as free radicals and pro-oxidants. A free radical is a molecule that contains a highly reactive unpaired electron. A pro-oxidant is a molecule that can promote oxidative damage. These highly reactive molecules can bind to and destroy other cellular components. Free-radical damage is a cause of aging and is also linked to the development of cancer, heart disease, cataracts, Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease, and arthritis, among others.<br><br>Most of the free radicals zipping through our bodies are actually produced during normal and necessary metabolic processes like energy generation, detoxification reactions, and immune defense mechanisms. The major source of free-radical damage in the body is actually the oxygen molecule, the very molecule that gives us life! Just as oxygen can rust iron, when toxic oxygen molecules are allowed to attack our cells free-radical or oxidative damage occurs.<br><br>Although the body&#x2019;s own generation of free radicals is significant, the environment contributes greatly to the free-radical load of an individual. Cigarette smoking, for example, greatly increases an individual&#x2019;s free-radical load. Many of the harmful effects of smoking are related to the extremely high levels of free radicals being inhaled, depleting key antioxidant nutrients like vitamin C and beta-carotene. Other external sources of free radicals include ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs, air pollutants, pesticides, anesthetics, aromatic hydrocarbons, fried food, solvents, alcohol, and formaldehyde. These compounds greatly stress the body&#x2019;s antioxidant mechanisms. Individuals exposed to these environmental factors need the additional nutritional support that fresh juices can provide.<br><br>With the help of antioxidants and enzymes found in the plant foods we consume, including carotenes, flavonoids, vitamins C and E, sulfur-containing compounds and many other phytochemicals, our cells can protect against free-radical and oxidative damage. Free radicals must be broken down by enzymes or be chemically neutralized before they react with cellular molecules. Examples of the free-radical scavenging enzymes produced by the body are catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase. Taking enzymes as an oral supplement has not been shown to increase enzyme tissue levels. However, ingesting antioxidant nutrients&#x2014;such as manganese, sulfur-containing amino acids, carotenes, flavonoids, and vitamin C&#x2014;has been shown to increase tissue concentrations of the enzymes.<br><br>The other way the cell can protect itself against free radical or oxidative damage is by chemical neutralization, or antioxidants binding to or neutralizing the free radical or pro-oxidant. Dietary antioxidants block free-radical damage by chemically reacting with the free radical or pro-oxidant to neutralize it. Ingesting fresh juices can increase tissue concentrations of antioxidant phytochemicals, thereby supporting normal protective mechanisms and blocking free-radical and oxidative damage to cells of the body.<br><br>the role of the diet in disease prevention<br><br>An extensive body of research has clearly established the link between the SAD and the development of the primary &#x201c;diseases of civilization&#x201d; such as heart disease, cancer, strokes, high blood pressure, diabetes, gallstones, arthritis, and many more. Likewise, one of the best bets in preventing virtually every chronic disease is a diet rich in fruits and vegetables of assorted colors. The evidence in support of this recommendation is so strong that it has been endorsed by U.S. government health agencies and by virtually every major medical organization, including the American Cancer Society.<br><br>Fruits and vegetables are so important in the battle against cancer that some experts believe that cancer is a result of a maladaptation over time to a reduced level of intake of fruits and vegetables. As a study published in the medical journal Cancer Causes and Control put it, &#x201c;Vegetables and fruit contain the anticarcinogenic cocktail to which we are adapted. We abandon it at our peril.&#x201d;1<br><br>A vast number of substances found in fruits and vegetables are known to protect against cancer. Collectively they are referred to as chemopreventers, but they are better known as phytochemicals. Phytochemicals include pigments such as carotenes, chlorophyll, and flavonoids; dietary fiber; enzymes; vitamin-like compounds; and other minor dietary constituents. Although they work in harmony with nutritional antioxidants like vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, phytochemicals exert considerably greater protection against cancer than these simple nutrients.<br><br>Among the most important groups of phytochemicals are pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenes, and flavonoids responsible for the color of many fruits and vegetables. One of my key dietary recommendations is for people to consume a &#x201c;rainbow&#x201d; diet; they need to focus on colorful fruits and vegetables (see table 1.1). Regularly consuming the full spectrum of fruit and vegetables&#x2014;red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple&#x2014;provides the body the full contingent of pigments with powerful antioxidant effects as well as the nutrients it needs for optimal function and protect against disease. Juicing provides a great way to color your diet with these life-giving foods.<br><br>Drinking at least 12 to 16 ounces of juice each day is as easy as swapping your morning coffee for juice. If you work away from home, make enough juice to fill your thermos and take it to work with you. A midmorning or midafternoon juice pick-me-up is a healthful way to keep your energy level high. At lunch and dinner, start your meal with a &#x201c;salad in a glass.&#x201d; Once you start experiencing some of the benefits of juicing, incorporating fresh fruit and vegetable juice in your daily routine will become second nature.<br><br>fresh juice vs. whole fruits and vegetables<br><br>You may ask, &#x201c;Why juice? Aren&#x2019;t we supposed to eat whole fruits and vegetables to get the fiber?&#x201d; The answer: Of course you are, but juice gets you more, faster. Juicing fresh fruits and vegetables does provide some fiber, particularly the soluble fiber that has been shown to lower cholesterol levels. Think about it&#x2014;fiber really refers to indigestible material found in plants; while this is important for proper bowel function, the juice of the plant ultimately contains the nutrients that nourish us. Our body actually converts the food we eat into juice so that it can be absorbed, so juicing actually saves the body energy, resulting in increased energy levels. Juicing also helps the body&#x2019;s digestive process and allows for quick absorption of high-quality nutrition. Juicing quickly provides the most easily digestible and concentrated nutritional benefits of fruits and vegetables.<br><br>fresh juice vs. canned, bottled, or frozen juices<br><br>Fresh juice not only contains greater nutritional values than its canned, bottled, or frozen counterparts, but it also contains enzymes and other &#x201c;living&#x201d; ingredients. In contrast, canned, bottled, and packaged juices have been pasteurized, which keeps them on the shelf longer causing the loss of identifiable vitamins and minerals as well as the loss of other factors not yet fully understood.<br><br>A group of researchers at Health Canada designed a scientific study comparing the antiviral activity of fresh apple juice to commercial apple juice from concentrate, apple cider, and apple wine.2 The most potent antiviral activity was found in fresh apple juice. Why? Commercial apple juices are produced using methods like pasteurization that destroy enzymes and alter many key compounds. In doing so, a great deal of the antiviral activity is also lost.<br><br>The compounds that are responsible for the antiviral activity of fresh apple juice are various flavonoid molecules. More will be discussed regarding these valuable compounds in chapter 3; the point being made here is that they are found in the highest quantities in fresh, not commercial apple juice (see table 1.2).<br><br>Fresh apple juice also contains ellagic acid, a compound that exerts potent antioxidant and anticancer properties,3 while commercial apple juice that has been cooked has been stripped of this enriching natural factor. Ellagic acid protects against damage to the chromosomes, while blocking the cancer-causing actions of many pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke and toxic chemicals such as benzopyrene. Ellagic acid is not destroyed by freezing or freeze-drying, but it can be destroyed by heat. While fresh whole apples and fresh apple juice contain 100 to 130 mg ellagic acid per 100 g (roughly 3.5 ounces), the amount found in cooked or commercial apple products is at or near zero.4 The flavonoid and ellagic acid content is exceptionally high in many berries, particularly raspberries and blackberries, which can contain up to 1.5 mg ellagic acid per gram. The levels in berries are approximately five to six times higher than those levels found in other foods.5 But again, that only applies to the fresh fruit or juice.<br><br>Another example of how freshness impacts nutritional value is dietary glutathione. Glutathione is a small protein composed of three amino acids manufactured in our cells, which aids in the detoxification of heavy metals such as lead as well as in the elimination of pesticides and solvents. Whether our bodies can meet the demand for glutathione is contingent on how much fresh vegetation we consume. While fresh fruits and vegetables provide ample glutathione, processed foods do not (see table 1.3).6 To derive the greatest benefit from our foods, we should consume them in their freshest forms.<br><br>At each step in the modern evolution of the orange, there is a loss of nutritional value. For example, the vitamin C content of pasteurized orange juice is extremely unreliable. As with most processed juices, the total nutritional quality is substantially lower than that of fresh juice. This is particularly true for juices stored in paperboard containers lined with wax or polyethylene. These products will lose up to 75 percent of their vitamin C content within three weeks.7 Frozen juice concentrates fare no better, and orange drinks have no vitamin C unless it is added. This highlights the fact that in the latter stages listed below there is not only a decrease in nutritional value, there is also an increase in the number of synthetic additives.<br><br>the modern evolution of the orange<br><br>Raw, whole oranges or freshly prepared orange juice<br><br>Refined, processed (pasteurized) unsweetened orange juice<br><br>Refined, processed, sweetened orange juice or concentrate<br><br>Refined, highly processed, sweetened, artificially colored, and flavored &#x201c;orange&#x201d; drinks<br><br>Completely fabricated products (such as Tang)<br><br>fresh juice vs. processed food products<br><br>The best way to reduce exposure to preservatives and other synthetic additives is to consume as many fresh and natural foods as possible.

Imagining Viking "conquerors" as much more numerous, technologically superior, and somehow inherently more warlike than their neighbors has overshadowed the cooperation and cultural exchange which characterized much of the Viking Age. In actuality, the Norse explorers and traders were players in a complex exchange of technology, customs, and religious beliefs between the ancient pre-Christian societies of northern Europe and the Christian-dominated nations surrounding the Mediterranean. </p><p>DuBois examines Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, and Mediterranean traditions to locate significant Nordic parallels in conceptions of supernatural beings, cults of the dead, beliefs in ghosts, and magical practices. These beliefs were actively held alongside Christianity for many years, and were finally incorporated into the vernacular religious practice. The Icelandic sagas reflect this complex process in their inclusion of both Christian and pagan details. </p><p>This work differs from previous examinations in its inclusion of the Christian thirteenth century as part of the evolution of Nordic religions from localized pagan cults to adherents of a larger Roman faith.</p><p>Thomas DuBois unravels for the first time the history of the Nordic religions in the Viking Age and shows how these ancient beliefs and their oral traditions incorporated both a myriad of local beliefs and aspects of foreign religions, most notably Christianity.</p></p><p>Thomas A.

Zachary Caine was pretty sure the seizure-inducing caterwauling that was harshing his mellow was annoying enough to reanimate the dead, of which he was one.</p><p>He was lying on his overstuffed blue leather recliner couch, affectionately known as Big Bertha, which he&#x2019;d had since his college days, while watching Sunday playoff football on mute because the unexpected houseguests he had were still asleep upstairs in all three of his bedrooms.</p><p>In what had seemed like a singular act of good manners at the time, he had insisted his company take the beds in his house while he took the couch. Now, having spent a sleepless night on Big Bertha because she had a dip in her middle the size of the Grand Canyon, he was sure his spine had been reconfigured into a serpentine S curve of pain. Clearly, chivalry was overrated.</p><p>Generally a cheerful, happy-go-lucky sort, Zach was feeling a tad surly. He glared at his couch mate Rufus, the cinnamon standard poodle he was dog sitting for a friend, who looked at him from beneath the poof of curly hair on his head as if trying to determine whether Zach wanted him to bark or not. Zach met his gaze and watched as Rufus rolled over and fell back asleep.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Zach asked the dog, who ignored him. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it your job to investigate strange noises or at the very least bark at them?&#x201d;</p><p>Rufus yawned and Zach watched as his eyes rolled back into his head.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeoooow!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Crap! What was making such a racket? Zach rolled onto his side, flinching through the back pain, and pulled a pillow over his head.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeoooow!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Argh! The wailing cut right through the fluffy pillow and now he could hear the sound of voices outside his front door, too. No, no, no! Go away! Seriously, if it was a door-to-door salesman, he might punch the guy in the throat on principle. His doorbell rang.</p><p>That did it! Zach threw the pillow across the room and pushed himself up to his feet. His back muscles protested by clenching into a hot ball of pain. He huffed out a breath and forced himself to shuffle to the door.</p><p>It was Sunday. Wasn&#x2019;t it supposed to be a day of rest? Why were people forcing him to be upright? And moving? It was just so wrong!</p><p>He unlocked the door and yanked it wide. He opened his mouth to bark at the rude people on his porch, since Rufus clearly wasn&#x2019;t going to do it, but the words never left his lips. Standing in front of him were two little cherubs with pink cheeks and tousled curls poking out from under their woolen hats, looking up at him with big blue imploring eyes. Uh-oh!</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, mister,&#x201d; the littler one said. &#x201c;We need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>Zach squinted at her. If this was a Girl Scout cookie dealer, he was all in. Those little round yummies of caramel coconut chewy goodness were his crack.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeooooooow!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Zach clapped his hands over his ears. There it was, that hideous noise again, only louder.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no, he&#x2019;s getting upset!&#x201d; The taller girl hurried off his porch and back down his walkway. She stopped a few feet away and stared up at his roof. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, boy, it&#x2019;s okay. We&#x2019;re getting help.&#x201d;</p><p><i>What the</i>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? Zach shoved his feet into the Timberland boots he&#x2019;d discarded by his front door and strode across his porch, down the steps, and onto the walk. The icy cold air of January in Maine felt like a closed-fist punch in the face, making him wince, but at least it was a new pain and distracted him from the ache in his back.</p><p>He stood beside the girl in the purple coat and glanced up. Peering at him over the lip of the narrow porch roof was a tiny orange tabby not much bigger than his fist.</p><p>The smaller girl in a blue coat joined them. She glanced up and looked exasperated. Then she wagged her pointer finger at the feline and said, &#x201c;You are a naughty kitty.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you get him down for us, sir, please?&#x201d; the girl in purple asked. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s just a baby. He might freeze to death.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeoooooow!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>For a little guy, he sure had decent lung capacity. For a wide variety of reasons, not the least of which was to end the cat&#x2019;s howling, Zach knew there was no way he was getting out of this without getting the kitten down.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s his name? Kitty?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; The younger one shook her head. She gave him an exasperated look. &#x201c;We call him Chaos.&#x201d;</p><p>Zach looked at her droll little face and laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course you do,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Good name.&#x201d;</p><p>The frigid winter air started to seep into his underdressed hide and he shivered. Flannel pajama bottoms and a thermal shirt were no match for temperatures in the twenties.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait here and keep an eye on him,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to get my ladder.&#x201d;</p><p>The girls looked so relieved he almost felt heroic. Glancing up at the kitten, who continued yowling, he figured he&#x2019;d better save the self-congratulations until after he got the little furball down.</p><p>As he strode back into the house, Rufus passed him, looking fierce. He barked, low and deep, and Zach shook his head at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Too little too late, my friend,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>Rufus ignored him and bounded toward the girls. The older one looked nervous and backed up, but the young girl opened her arms wide.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a dog?&#x201d; she cried, as if this were the greatest news ever.</p><p>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m temporarily dog sitting him. Don&#x2019;t worry, he loves kids.&#x201d;</p><p>As if to prove Zach right, Rufus dropped onto his back in the snow at the girls&#x2019; feet, offering his belly for rubs. Both girls laughed and Zach hurried inside, grabbed a thick chambray shirt off the back of a chair, and drew it on without bothering to button it. He then took the shortcut through the small house to the garage door.</p><p>He lifted the ladder off its wall brackets and opened the side door that let him back out into his front yard. He didn&#x2019;t want to raise the garage door for fear he&#x2019;d scare the kitten into doing something stupid. Although one could argue that climbing onto his roof was pretty dumb to begin with, especially on a day when the high temperature was twenty-seven degrees and the ground still had a few feet of snow on it from the icy dumping they&#x2019;d gotten yesterday. How had the little scrapper gotten up there anyway?</p><p>He set the base of the ladder on the ground and propped the top against the porch roof. It took some adjusting, but when it felt steady he began to climb. Not a fan of heights, Zach wasn&#x2019;t surprised when the world did one swift revolution, forcing him to grip the sides of the ladder. He closed his eyes for a second, allowing the vertigo to pass before he attempted to continue on.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry, mister, he&#x2019;s stopped crying. I think his voice is frozen,&#x201d; the little one ordered.</p><p>&#x201c;Please hurry,&#x201d; the older one added.</p><p>Zach opened his eyes and kept going. He was almost at the roof when a shriek sounded from next door. Dang, this had to be the loudest Sunday in the history of the neighborhood.</p><p>&#x201c;Maddie! Gracie! Where are you?&#x201d; a woman&#x2019;s voice cried.</p><p>&#x201c;Over here, Momma,&#x201d; the younger one answered. She waved as if her mother needed the visual to notice the man on the ladder just twenty yards from where she stood, looking bug-eyed and frantic.</p><p>The woman looked as disheveled as Zach felt as she raced across the two yards to grab her girls close.</p><p>&#x201c;What are you doing over here?&#x201d; she cried. &#x201c;Girls, you know the rules. You are never to leave the backyard without me. I went inside for a tissue and when I came out, you were both gone! You scared me to death!&#x201d;</p><p>She kissed one head and then the other, as if to reassure herself that they were fine.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeooooooow!</i>&#x201d; Clearly put out that he didn&#x2019;t have everyone&#x2019;s attention, Chaos let loose his loudest, most grating yowl yet.</p><p>Zach was pretty sure his ears had started to bleed. He gritted his teeth and climbed to the top, determined to get this cat and his people away from his Sunday sanctuary of playoff football, nachos, and naps.</p><p>&#x201c;We found Chaos, Momma, he&#x2019;s on this man&#x2019;s roof,&#x201d; the older one said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hi, Zach,&#x201d; she said. She glanced up and when her gaze met his, her face turned bright red. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. You don&#x2019;t have to do that. I can climb up there.&#x201d;</p><p>Jessie Connelly. Zach had met her a few months ago when he&#x2019;d brought his friend&#x2019;s foul-mouthed parrot into the local veterinary office where Jessie worked. He&#x2019;d made the mistake of calling her &#x201c;sweetheart,&#x201d; and she had let him have it. He was pretty sure he still had scars from the tongue lashing she&#x2019;d given him.</p><p>At the time, he&#x2019;d had no idea that they were neighbors. Jessie had been all too aware that he lived next door and she had a lot to say about how she assumed he lived his life. Being a live and let live sort, Zach had steered clear of her ever since.</p><p>He must have done a heck of a job avoiding her, because up until now he&#x2019;d had no idea that she had two daughters. He wondered if she was feeling badly about their last meeting now that he was saving her daughters&#x2019; kitten.</p><p>Feeling mischievous, he almost called her &#x201c;sweetheart&#x201d; or &#x201c;honey&#x201d; or &#x201c;baby girl&#x201d; just to see if she&#x2019;d rip into him again.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Yeeeoooow!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>Luckily, the kitten was keeping him on task. He turned back to the cat, calling over his shoulder, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry. I&#x2019;ve got this.&#x201d;</p><p>He trudged up the ladder. When he was nose to nose with the cat, he paused to figure out the best way to grab it. The orange tabby with pale green eyes looked cold and miserable and Zach realized if anyone was having a worse Sunday than he, it was this cat. He held out his hand, thinking the cat would be grateful to climb aboard. The cat took a swipe at him. Okay, then.</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; he asked it. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to help you out here.&#x201d;</p><p>The cat hissed and his little back arched. The critter had spunk, Zach would give him that. He&#x2019;d been out here a while now and it was bone-achingly cold. How the little guy hadn&#x2019;t turned into a furry ice cube Zach couldn&#x2019;t fathom.</p><p>He reached out again, trying to coax the feisty feline with reassuring words.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, little fella,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to hurt you. I&#x2019;m just going to get you off the roof so you can go home with your people.&#x201d;</p><p>He held his hand still and Chaos cautiously sniffed his cold skin. Zach didn&#x2019;t know how much longer he could stay out here without gloves and not lose his fingers. He silently willed the cat to trust him.</p><p>When Chaos put a cautious paw on his hand and Zach reached out with his other hand to grab the kitten, Rufus let out a bark of encouragement. A loud one. The cat jumped and hissed, causing Zach to jump and his ladder to wobble. Still, he managed to grab the cat by the scruff of the neck.</p><p>He hauled the little furball into his chest, clutching him close with both hands. When he tried to step down without the use of his hands, he felt the bottom of the ladder shift from all of the movement above. As if in slow motion, the ladder tipped away from the roof of the porch.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, no, mister, look out!&#x201d; one of the girls cried.</p><p>It was too late. Zach couldn&#x2019;t grab the roof without dropping the cat. He couldn&#x2019;t risk the little guy like that, so he tucked him into his chest and just relaxed his body into the fall. The ladder slid, wobbled, slid again, and the next thing Zach knew he was free-falling toward the ground.</p><p>Having no idea what he was going to land on, Zach had to revise his earlier assessment. He was most definitely having a worse Sunday than the cat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p><i>Thump!</i> Zach felt his body drop into a soft cushion of freezing cold snow. The icy, wet chill engulfed his entire body and snow fell in on top of him, burying him in the large snowdrift. Chilly, but at least his head hadn&#x2019;t split like a big cantaloupe on his paved driveway.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, my god! Are you all right?&#x201d; Jessie cried as she hurried forward.</p><p>Zach popped his eyes open to find her staring down at him. Her big blue eyes were filled with alarm and she was uselessly flapping her bare hands at her sides as if she was trying to achieve liftoff. Her green puffy coat was unzipped and her woolen hat with the oversize pom-pom, earflaps, and braids was askew, allowing a chunk of two-tone bangs to drape over her forehead, almost covering her eyes.</p><p>Before he could answer her, she dropped to her knees beside him and began to brush him off, digging him out of the pile of snow.</p><p>&#x201c;Chaos, see what happens when you wander off?&#x201d; the younger girl chastised the cat as her older sister scooped him off Zach&#x2019;s chest and held him close.</p><p>Rufus sniffed the kitten, who ignored him and burrowed into the girl&#x2019;s coat.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, mister.&#x201d; The younger sister joined her mother in the snowbank and grabbed Zach&#x2019;s hands with one of her icy cold mittens, not that Zach could feel anything as his fingers were pretty much numb. She tried to pull him up but he was still half buried.</p><p>&#x201c;We need to get you inside,&#x201d; Jessie said. She began to brush the snow off his pajama bottoms. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re frozen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no, I&#x2019;m fine,&#x201d; he protested. With Jessie&#x2019;s hands brushing off <i>all </i>of his body, he was suddenly relieved that he was numb from the chest down. His teeth began chattering as he tried to roll to his feet without success. &#x201c;J-j-just g-glad you have y-your cat back. You should p-probably t-take him home now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll help you inside first,&#x201d; she insisted.</p><p>Jessie braced her feet against the icy part of the snowbank and used her body weight to haul him to his feet. She was stronger than she looked and he fell against her, slipping on the icy ground as he tried to get his balance. He flailed and one hand landed on her shoulder while the other latched onto the front of her coat. It took him a second to realize he was clutching her boob and he jumped back, dropping his hand and skidding on a patch of ice in his effort to get away from her.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry, sorry,&#x201d; he said. He raised his hands in the air as if trying to prove he hadn&#x2019;t been trying to cop a feel.</p><p>Jessie looked startled and then like she was trying not to laugh as his feet scrabbled on the slippery ground and his arms windmilled as he tried to get his balance. She pursed her lips and stepped forward, catching him about the waist and pulling one of his arms over her shoulder.</p><p>&#x201c;Come on,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Before you damage something permanently.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No worries. My dignity has already been frozen off,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>This time she did laugh.</p><p>&#x201c;Maddie, go get the door for us, sweetie,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The younger girl in the blue coat scampered up the steps and pushed open his front door. Jessie half carried, half dragged him up the steps with Rufus and the other girl&#x2014;whom she had called Gracie&#x2014;bringing up the rear, still holding Chaos the kitten.</p><p>Zach did a quick scan to make sure his sparsely decorated bachelor pad didn&#x2019;t have any stray underwear or socks kicking around or anything else that might damage a young girl&#x2019;s psyche. Other than an empty pizza box on the counter and a newspaper on the coffee table, the place was clear. The game was still on and he glanced at the screen to catch the score. His Cowboys were up.

Brother is pitted against sister over the fate of their heirloom piano.</p></p><p>August Wilson is the most influential and successful African American playwright writing today. He is the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Fences, The Piano Lesson, King Hedley II, Ma Rainy&#39;s Black Bottom, Joe Turner&#39;s Come and Gone, Seven Guitars, Two Trains Running, Jitney and Radio Golf. His plays have been produced all over the world.Drama in two acts by August Wilson, produced in 1987 and published in 1990. The play, which was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1990, is part of Wilson's cycle about African-American life in the 20th century. The action takes place in Pittsburgh in 1936 at the house of a family of African-Americans who have migrated from Mississippi. The conflict centers around a piano that was once traded by the family's white master for two of the family's ancestors. Boy Willie and Berniece, the siblings who inherit the piano (carved to show family history), argue about whether or not to sell it. Berniece's climactic refusal to allow Boy Willie to move the piano exorcises both the literal and figurative ghost of the white slave owner who has been haunting the family. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Exploring the Gospel of Matthew (John Phillips Commentary Series) (The John Phillips Commentary Series)</h2><p>"John Phillips writes with enthusiasm and clarity, . . . cutting through the confusion and heretical dangers associated with Bible interpretation." &#x2014;<i>Moody</i> magazine</p><p>John Phillips (1927-2010) served as assistant director of the Moody Correspondence School as well as director of the Emmaus Correspondence School, one of the world&#x2019;s largest Bible correspondence ministries.

Elliott Smith's <i>XO</i> should not be one of them. Smith's 1998 major label debut defies the "tortured singer-songwriter" stereotype, and takes up this defiance as a central theme. At a time when Smith was being groomed for a particular (and particularly condescending) brand of stardom, he produced a record that eviscerated one of the central assumptions of singersongwriterdom: that pain is beautiful. <i>XO</i> insists that romanticizing personal tragedy can only leave you "deaf and dumb and done." And it backs up this claim with some of the most artful and intelligent music of its day.

It was a strange company for many reasons, not the least of which was that we had no employees from beginning to end. I wrote every line of code and did all the accounting and customer support.</p><p>The terms of the deal were such that my cofounder and I didn&#x2019;t have to work for the acquiring company at all. We were free to move on to other things, and we did. A few months later my wife and I moved from our 865-square-foot apartment near Boston to a country house twenty-five miles outside of Philadelphia. I had just turned twenty-seven.</p><p>She went to her job and I sat at home doing nothing for the first time in my life. We knew no one for a hundred miles in any direction.</p><p>Naturally, I started tinkering on the computer again, starting about a dozen side projects simultaneously. A year and a half later, I thought I was on to something. I noticed two things that bothered me about Google: too much spam (all those sites with nothing but ads) and not enough instant answers (I kept going to Wikipedia and IMDb). I thought if I could easily pick out the spam and the answers, then I&#x2019;d have a more compelling search engine.</p><p>Both problems were harder to solve than I initially thought, but I thoroughly enjoyed the work and kept at it. Everyone I talked to about my search engine project thought I was nuts. You&#x2019;re doing what? Competing against Google? Why? How? Another year later, in the fall of 2008, I flipped the switch, unveiling my search engine to the public.</p><p>DuckDuckGo had a rather uneventful launch, if you can even call it a launch. I posted it to a niche tech site called <i>Hacker News</i> and that was the long and short of it. The post was entitled &#x201c;What do you think of my new search engine?&#x201d;</p><p>Like many entrepreneurs, I&#x2019;m motivated by being on the cusp of something big, and I was at the point where I needed some validation. I can survive on little, but I needed something.</p><p>I got it.</p><p>Granted, the product wasn&#x2019;t anything you&#x2019;d want to switch to at that point, and people let me know that. It was an Internet forum, after all. However, I still felt there was genuine interest in a new search competitor. I could tell some people were growing wary of what Google was becoming. For example, those initial conversations led me to investigate search privacy and eventually become &#x201c;the search engine that doesn&#x2019;t track you,&#x201d; years before government and corporate surveillance became a mainstream issue.</p><p>In any case, the response I received was enough motivation to keep me going. Which brings me to traction. I needed some.</p><p>Traction is the best way to improve your chances of startup success. Traction is a sign that something is working. If you charge for your product, it means customers are buying. If your product is free, it&#x2019;s a growing user base.</p><p>Traction is powerful. Technical, market, and team risks are easier to address with traction. Fund-raising, hiring, press, partnerships, and acquisitions all become much easier.</p><p>In other words, <i>traction trumps everything</i>.</p><p>My last startup had grown using two traction channels: first, search engine optimization (ranking high in search engines for relevant terms), and later, viral marketing (where your customers bring in other customers, such as by referring friends and family through use of the product).</p><p>Viral marketing doesn&#x2019;t work well in search because you can&#x2019;t easily bake it into the product by putting stuff between people and their search results. So I tried search engine optimization. The terms &#x201c;search engine&#x201d; and &#x201c;search engines&#x201d; were too hard to rank for, as the high-ranking companies had been around for a decade and had tens of thousands of links pointing at them from their long histories. &#x201c;New search engine&#x201d; was more in my grasp.</p><p>I worked hard for many months to rank high for this phrase. The key to good search engine optimization (SEO) is getting links. As you will read later in the SEO chapter, you need a strategy to get these links in a scalable way.</p><p>Getting stories written about you in blogs and news outlets is a common SEO linking strategy. However, I hit saturation with that channel strategy pretty quickly and it didn&#x2019;t get me to the top. Something more creative was required.</p><p>After much brainstorming and experimenting, I eventually hit upon a good idea. I built a karma widget that would display links to your social media profiles and how many followers you had on each service. People would embed it on their sites and at the bottom there would be a link back to DuckDuckGo that said &#x201c;new search engine.&#x201d;</p><p>This channel strategy worked beautifully. I was number one.</p><p>Trouble was, not a ton of people make that search&#x2014;about fifty a day. So while I did get some traction and a steady stream of new users, it leveled off pretty quickly. It wasn&#x2019;t enough traction to be meaningful. It didn&#x2019;t move the needle.</p><p>I made two large traction mistakes here. First, I failed to have a concrete traction goal. In retrospect, to move the needle for my traction goals at the time, I needed more like five thousand new visitors a day, not fifty. Search engine optimization was not going to get me there.</p><p>Second, I was biased by my previous experience. Just because my last company got traction in this way didn&#x2019;t mean it was right for every company.</p><p>These are very natural mistakes to make. In fact, most startups make them. The most common startup trajectory now goes something like the following:</p><p>Founders have an idea for a company they&#x2019;re excited about. Initial excitement turns into a struggle to build a product, but they do get something out the door.</p><p>Launch!</p><p>The founders expected customers to beat a path to their door, but unfortunately that isn&#x2019;t happening. Getting traction was an afterthought, but now they are focused on it. They try what they know or what they&#x2019;ve heard others do: some Facebook ads, a little local PR, and maybe a smattering of blog posts.</p><p>Then they run out of money and the company dies.</p><p>Sadly, this is the norm. Even sadder, often these products are actually on to something. That is, with the right traction strategy they might have actually been able to get traction and not go out of business.</p><p>Given my previous startup success I thought I knew what I was doing. I was wrong. Luckily, I wasn&#x2019;t dead wrong. I had the money to self-fund through my traction mistakes, and so they didn&#x2019;t prove fatal for DuckDuckGo. Not everyone is as lucky.</p><p>Right when I realized I was making these mistakes I also realized I didn&#x2019;t know the right way to go about getting traction at all. I asked around. It turns out there was no good framework for getting traction, and that&#x2019;s how this book was born, way back in 2009.</p><p>Around this time I also started angel investing and more seriously advising other startups. I saw firsthand similar struggles and mistakes. I also partnered with Justin Mares, my coauthor. Justin founded two startups (one of which was acquired) and recently ran growth at Exceptional Cloud Services, which was acquired by Rackspace in 2013 for millions. He&#x2019;s a growth expert in his own right.</p><p>We set out to help startups get traction no matter what business they were in: from Internet companies to local small businesses and everything in between. We drew on our personal experiences, interviewed more than forty founders, studied many more companies, and pulled out the repeatable framework they used to succeed.</p><p>That framework is Bullseye, a simple three-step process for getting traction. Bullseye works for startups of all kinds: consumer or enterprise focused, large or small.</p><p>Since DuckDuckGo&#x2019;s humble beginnings, we have grown five orders of magnitude (10x growth spurts), from that initial one hundred searches a day to now over ten million a day. Each step&#x2014;from 100 to 1,000, 10,000 to 100,000, 1,000,000 to 10,000,000&#x2014;involved figuring out how to get traction again. That&#x2019;s because, as you will see, often what works in one growth stage eventually stops working.</p><p>Thankfully we had Bullseye to help us find the right traction channel strategy at the right time. After my search engine optimization mistake, we shifted to using content marketing, social and display ads, publicity, and most recently business development. We&#x2019;ve hit the bull&#x2019;s-eye repeatedly, and so can you.</p><p></p><p></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>Traction Channels</p><p>Before we get started, let&#x2019;s define traction. Traction is a sign that your company is taking off. It&#x2019;s obvious in your core metrics: If you have a mobile app, your download rate is growing rapidly. If you&#x2019;re running a subscription service, your monthly revenue is skyrocketing. If you&#x2019;re an organic bakery, your number of transactions is increasing every week. You get the point.</p><p>Naval Ravikant, founder of AngelList, an online platform that helps companies raise money, says it well:</p><p><i>Traction is basically quantitative evidence of customer demand. So if you&#x2019;re in enterprise software, [initial traction] may be two or three early customers who are paying a bit; if you&#x2019;re in consumer software the bar might be as high as hundreds of thousands of users.</i></p><p>You can always get more traction. The whole point of a startup is to grow rapidly. Getting traction means moving your growth curve up and to the right as best you can. Paul Graham, founder of startup accelerator Y Combinator, puts it like this:</p><p><i>A startup is a company designed to grow fast. Being newly founded does not in itself make a company a startup. Nor is it necessary for a startup to work on technology, or take venture funding, or have some sort of &#x201c;exit.&#x201d; The only essential thing is growth. Everything else we associate with startups follows from growth.</i></p><p>Traction is growth. The pursuit of traction is what defines a startup.</p><p>After interviewing more than forty successful founders and researching countless more, we discovered that startups get traction through <i>nineteen different channels</i>. Many successful startups experimented with multiple channels until they found one that worked.</p><p>We call these customer acquisition channels <i>traction channels</i>. These are marketing and distribution channels through which your startup can get traction: real customer growth.</p><p>We uncovered two broad themes through our research. First, most founders consider using only traction channels with which they&#x2019;re already familiar, or those they think they should be using because of their type of product or company. This means that far too many startups focus on the same channels and ignore other promising ways to get traction. In fact, often the most underutilized channels in an industry are the most promising ones.</p><p>Second, it&#x2019;s hard to predict the traction channel that will work best. You can make educated guesses, but until you start running tests, it&#x2019;s difficult to tell which channel is the best one for you right now.</p><p>Our introductory chapters 2&#x2013;5 expand on these themes. Chapter 2 introduces you to traction thinking: the mind-set you need to adopt to maximize your chances of getting traction. Chapter 3 presents our framework for getting traction called Bullseye. Essentially, it involves targeted experimentation with a few traction channels, followed by laser focus on the core channel that is most promising.</p><p>Chapter 4 explains how to go about running traction tests, a central theme of Bullseye. Chapter 5 presents a second framework&#x2014;called Critical Path&#x2014;to help you focus on the right traction goal and ignore everything else not required to achieve it.</p><p>Before you jump into this material, however, we&#x2019;d like to introduce you to the nineteen traction channels and some of the people we interviewed for them. We will explore each of these channels in chapters 6&#x2013;24.</p><p>When going through the traction channels, try your best not to dismiss them as irrelevant for your company. Each traction channel has worked for startups of all kinds and phases. As mentioned, the right channel is often an underutilized one. Get one channel working that your competitors dismiss, and you can grow rapidly while they languish.</p><p>Targeting Blogs</p><p>Popular startups like Codecademy, Mint, and reddit all got their start by targeting blogs. Noah Kagan, Mint&#x2019;s former director of marketing, told us how he targeted niche blogs early on, and how this strategy allowed Mint to acquire forty thousand customers before launching.</p><p>Publicity</p><p>Publicity is the art of getting your name out there via traditional media outlets like newspapers, magazines, and TV. We interviewed Jason Kincaid, former <i>TechCrunch</i> writer, about pitching media outlets, how to form relationships with reporters, and what most startups do wrong when it comes to publicity. We also talked with Ryan Holiday, media strategist and bestselling author of <i>Trust Me, I&#x2019;m Lying</i>, to learn how startups could leverage today&#x2019;s rapidly changing media landscape to get traction.</p><p>Unconventional PR</p><p>Unconventional PR involves doing something exceptional like publicity stunts to draw media attention. This channel can also work by repeatedly going above and beyond for your customers. Alexis Ohanian told us some of the things he did to get people talking about reddit and Hipmunk, two startups he cofounded.</p><p>Search Engine Marketing</p><p>Search engine marketing (SEM) allows companies to advertise to consumers searching on Google and other search engines. We interviewed Matthew Monahan of Inflection, the company behind Archives.com (before its $100 million acquisition by Ancestry.com), to learn how Archives relied primarily on SEM for its growth.</p><p>Social and Display Ads</p><p>Ads on popular sites like reddit, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and hundreds of other niche sites can be a powerful and scalable way to reach new customers. We brought in Nikhil Sethi, founder of the social ad buying platform Adaptly, to talk with us about getting traction with social and display ads.</p><p>Offline Ads</p><p>Offline ads include TV spots, radio commercials, billboards, infomercials, newspaper and magazine ads, as well as flyers and other local advertisements. These ads reach demographics that are harder to target online, like seniors, less tech-savvy consumers, and commuters. Few startups use this channel, which means there&#x2019;s less competition for many of these audiences. We talked with Jason Cohen, founder of WP Engine and Smart Bear Software, about the offline ads he&#x2019;s used to acquire customers.</p><p>Search Engine Optimization</p><p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of making sure your Web site shows up for key search results. We interviewed Rand Fishkin of Moz (the market leader in SEO software) to talk about best practices for getting traction with SEO. Patrick McKenzie, founder of Appointment Reminder, also explained to us how he uses SEO to cheaply acquire lots of highly targeted traffic.</p><p>Content Marketing</p><p>Many startups have blogs. However, most don&#x2019;t use their blogs to get traction. We talked with Unbounce founder Rick Perreault and OkCupid cofounder Sam Yagan to learn how their blogs transformed their businesses.</p><p>Email Marketing</p><p>Email mark...</p></p><h2>Improvement: A Novel</h2><p><b>WINNER FOR THE 2018 PEN/FAULKNER AWARD FOR FICTION</b><br><br> <strong>WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD FOR FICTION</strong><br><br> <strong>AUTHOR IS THE WINNER OF THE 2018 PEN/MALAMUD AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE SHORT STORY</strong><br><br> <b>Named 1 of 6 New Paperbacks You Should Read in August by&nbsp;<i>Vulture</i><br> Named 1 of 10 Top Fiction Titles of 2017 by the&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br> Named 1 of 50 Notable Works of Fiction in 2017 by&nbsp;<i>The Washington Post</i><br> A&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;Paperback Row Selection<br> A&nbsp;<i>Newsday</i>&nbsp;Best Book of 2017<br> A&nbsp;<i>Kirkus</i>&nbsp;Best Book of 2017<br> A&nbsp;<i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;Editor's Choice</b><br><br> One of our most gifted writers of fiction returns with a bold and piercing novel about a young single mother living in New York, her eccentric aunt, and the decisions they make that have unexpected implications for the world around them.<br><br> Reyna knows her relationship with Boyd isn&#x2019;t perfect, yet as she visits him throughout his three-month stint at Rikers Island, their bond grows tighter.

People travel and they find places they like so much they think they've risen to their best selves just by being there. They feel distant from everyone at home who can't begin to understand. They take up with beautiful locals of the opposite sex, they settle in, they get used to how everything works, they make homes. But maybe not forever.</p> <p>I had an aunt who was such a person. She went to Istanbul when she was in her twenties. She met a good-looking carpet seller from Cappadocia. She'd been a classics major in college and had many questions to ask him, many observations to offer. He was a gentle and intelligent man who spent his days talking to travelers. He'd come to think he no longer knew what to say to Turkish girls, and he loved my aunt's airy conversation. When her girlfriends went back to Greece, she stayed behind and moved in with him. This was in 1970.</p> <p>His shop was in Sultanahmet, where tourists went, and he lived in Fener, an old and jumbled neighborhood. Kiki, my aunt, liked having people over, and their apartment was always filled with men from her husband's region and expats of various ages. She was happy to cook big semi-Turkish meals and make up the couch for anyone passing through. She helped out in the store, explained carpet motifs to anyone who walked in&#x2015;those were stars for happiness, scorpion designs to keep real scorpions away. In her letters home, she sounded enormously pleased with herself&#x2015;she dropped Turkish phrases into her sentences, reported days spent sipping <i>�ay</i> and <i>kahve</i>. All this became lore in my family.</p> <p>She wrote to her father, who suffered from considerable awkwardness in dealing with his children (her mother had died some six years before), and to her kid brother, who was busy hating high school. The family was Jewish, from a forward-thinking leftist strain; Kiki had gone to camps where they sang songs about children of all nations, so no one had any bigoted objections to her Turkish boyfriend. Kiki sent home to Brooklyn a carpet she said was from the Taurus Mountains. Her father said, "Very handsome colors. I see you are a connoisseur. No one is walking on it, I promise."</p> <p>Then Kiki's boyfriend's business took a turn for the worse. There was a flood in the basement of his store and a bill someone never paid and a new shop nearby that was getting all the business. Or something. The store had to close. Her family thought this meant that Kiki was coming home at last. But, no. Osman, her guy, had decided to move back to the village he was from, to help his father, who raised pumpkins for their seed-oil. Also tomatoes, green squash, and eggplant. Kiki was up for the move; she wanted to see the real Turkey. Istanbul was really so Western now. Cappadocia was very ancient and she couldn't wait to see the volcanic rock. She was getting married! Her family in Brooklyn was surprised about that part. Were they invited to the wedding? Apparently not. In fact, it had already happened by the time they got the letter. "I get to wear a beaded hat and a glitzy headscarf, the whole shebang," Kiki wrote. "I still can't believe it."</p> <p>Neither could any of her relatives. But they sent presents, once they had an address. A microwave oven, a Mister Coffee, an electric blanket for the cold mountains. They were a practical and liberal family, they wanted to be helpful. They didn't hear from Kiki for a while and her father worried that the gifts had been stolen in the mail. "I know it's hard for you to imagine," Kiki wrote, "but we do very well without electricity here. Every morning I make a wood fire in the stove. Very good-smelling smoke. I make a little fire at the bottom of the water heater too."</p> <p>Kiki built fires? No one could imagine her as the pioneer wife. Her brother, Alan (who later became my father), asked what kind of music she listened to there and if she had a radio. She sent him cassette tapes of favorite Turkish singers&#x2015;first a crappy male crooner and then a coolly plaintive woman singer who was really very good. Alan was always hoping to visit, but first he was in college and working as a house painter in the summers and then he had a real job in advertising that he couldn't leave. Kiki said not a word about making any visits home. Her father offered to pay for two tickets to New York so they could all meet her husband, but Kiki wrote, "Oh, Dad. Spend your money on better things." No one nagged her; she'd been a touchy teenager, given to sullen outbursts, and everyone was afraid of that Kiki appearing again.</p> <p>She stayed for eight years. Her letters said, "My husband thinks I sew as well as his sisters," and "I'm rereading my copy of Ovid in Latin. It's not bad!" and "Winter is sooo long this year, I hate it. Osman has already taught me all he knows about the stars." No one could make sense of who she was now or put the parts together. There were no children and no pregnancies that anyone heard about, and the family avoided asking.</p> <p>Her brother was finally about to get himself over for a visit, when Kiki wrote to say, "Guess what? I'm coming back at last. For good. Cannot wait to see you all."</p> <p>"Cannot wait, my ass," her brother said. "She waited fine. What's so irresistible now?"</p> <p>No, the husband was not coming with her. "My life here has reached its natural conclusion," Kiki wrote. "Osman will be my dear friend forever but we've come to the end of our road."</p> <p>"So who ran around on who?" the relatives kept asking. "She'll never say, will she?"</p> <p>Everybody wondered what she would look like when she arrived. Would she be sun-dried and weather-beaten, would she wear billowing silk trousers like a belly dancer, would the newer buildings of New York amaze her, would she gape at the Twin Towers? None of the above. She looked like the same old Kiki, thirty-one with very good skin, and she was wearing jeans and a turtleneck, possibly the same ones she'd left home with. She said, "God! Look at YOU!" when she saw her brother, grown from a scrawny teenager to a man in a sport jacket. She said, "Been a while, hasn't it?" to her dad.</p> <p>Her luggage was a mess, very third-world, woven plastic valises baled up with string, and there were a lot of them. She had brought back nine carpets! What was she thinking? She wanted to sell them. To someone or other.</p> <p>Her brother always remembered that when they ate their first meal together, Kiki held her knife and fork like a European. She laughed at things lightly, as if the absurdity of it all wasn't worth shrieking over. She teased Alan about his eyeglasses ("you look like a genius in them") and his large appetite ("has not changed since you were eight"). She certainly sounded like herself. Wasn't she tired from her flight? "No big deal," she said.</p> <p>She'd had a crappy job in a bookstore before going off on her travels, so what was she going to do now? Did she have any friends left from before? It seemed that she did. Before very long, she moved in with someone named Marcy she'd known at Brooklyn College. Marcy's mother bought the biggest of the rugs, and Kiki used the proceeds to start renting a storefront in the East Village, where she displayed her carpets and other items she had brought back&#x2015;a brass tea set and turquoise beads and cotton pants with gathered hems that she herself had once worn.</p> <p>The store stayed afloat for a while. Her brother sort of wondered if she was dealing drugs&#x2015;hashish was all over Istanbul in the movie <i>Midnight Express</i>, which came out just before her return. Kiki refused to see such a film, with its lurid scenes of mean Turkish prisons. "Who has <i>nice</i> prisons?" she said. "Name me one single country in the world. Just one."</p> <p>When her store began to fail and she had to give it up, Kiki supported herself by cleaning houses. She evidently did this with a good spirit; the family was much more embarrassed about it than she was. "People here don't know <i>how</i> to clean their houses," she would say. "It's sort of remarkable, isn't it?"</p> <p>By the time I was a little kid, Kiki had become the assistant director of a small agency that booked housekeepers and nannies. She was the one you got on the phone, the one who didn't take any nonsense from either clients or workers. She was friendly but strict and kept people on point.</p> <p>I was only a teeny bit afraid of her as a child. She could be very withering if I was acting up and getting crazy and knocking over chairs. But when my parents took me to visit, Kiki had special cookies for me (I loved Mallomars), and for a while she had a boyfriend named Hernando who would play airplane with me and go buzzing around the room. I loved visiting her. </p> <p>My father told me later that Hernando had wanted to marry Kiki. "But she wasn't made for marriage," he said. "It's not all roses, you know." He and my mother had a history of having, as they say, their differences.</p> <p>"Kiki was always like a bird," my father said. "Flying here and there."</p> <p>What a corny thing to say.</p><br> <p>I grew up on the outskirts of Boston, in a neighborhood whose leafy familiarity I spurned once I was old enough for hip disdain. I moved to New York as soon as I finished high school, which I barely did. My parents and I were not on good terms in my early years in the city. They hated the guy I first took off with, and my defense of him often turned into insulting them. And I really had no use for more school, and they could never take this in. But Kiki made a point of keeping in touch. She'd call on the phone and say, "I'm thirsty, let's go have a drink. Okay?" At first I was up in Inwood, as far north in Manhattan as you can get, so it was a long subway ride to see her in the East Village, but once I moved to Harlem it wasn't quite so bad. When my son was born, four years ago, Kiki brought me the most useful layette of baby stuff, things a person couldn't even know she needed. Oliver would calm down and sleep when she walked him around. He grew up calling her Aunt Great Kiki.</p> <p>The two of us lived in a housing project, one of the nicer ones, in an apartment illegally passed on to me by a boyfriend. It was a decent size, with good light, and I liked my neighbors. They were a great mix, and nobody wanted to rat on me about the lease. They'd stopped thinking I was another white gentrifier, sneaking in.</p> <p>In late October of the year that the TV kept telling us to get prepared for Hurricane Sandy, Oliver had a great time flicking the flashlight on and off (a really annoying game) and watching me tape giant <i>x</i>'s on the window glass. All the kids on our hallway were hyped up and excited, running around and yelling. We kept looking out the windows as the sky turned a sepia tint. When the rains broke and began to come down hard, we could hear the moaning of the winds and everything clattering and banging in the night, awnings and trees getting the hell beaten out of them. I kept switching to different channels on TV so we wouldn't miss any of it. The television had better coverage than my view out the window. Through the screen a newscaster in a suit told us the Con Ed substation on Fourteenth Street had exploded! The lights in the bottom of Manhattan had gone out! I made efforts to explain to Oliver about electricity, as if I knew. Never, never put your finger in a socket. Oliver wanted to watch a better program. </p> <p>At nine thirty the phone rang and it was my father, who had more patience with me these days but didn't call that often. He was calling to say, "Your aunt Kiki doesn't have power, you know. She's probably sitting in the dark." I had forgotten about her entirely. She was on East Fifth Street, in the no-electricity zone. I promised I'd check on Kiki in the morning. </p> <p>"I might have to walk there," I said. "It's like a hundred twenty blocks. You're not going to ask about my neighborhood? It's fine."</p> <p>"How's Oliver?"</p> <p>"Great."</p> <p>"Don't forget about Kiki, okay? Tell me that."</p> <p>"I just told you," I said.</p></p><h2>Before Freedom, When I Just Can Remember: Personal Accounts of Slavery in South Carolina</h2><p>During the 1930s, the Federal Writers&#x2019; Project undertook the task of locating former slaves and recording their oral histories. The more than ten thousand pages of interviews with over two thousand former slaves were filed in the Library of Congress, where they were known to scholars and historians but few others. From this storehouse of information, Belinda Hurmence has chosen twenty-seven narratives from the twelve hundred typewritten pages of interviews with 284 former South Carolina slaves. The result is a moving, eloquent, and often surprising firsthand account of the last years of slavery and first years of freedom. The former slaves describe the clothes they wore, the food they ate, the houses they lived in, the work they did, and the treatment they received.

As she notes in her introduction, the former slaves' seeming nostalgia for old times may have resulted from their ages (all were over 80 at the time of the interviews) and Depression-linked poverty, the reality that freedom often meant sharecropping and violence from the KKK, and the fact that their interviewers were white. Nonetheless, the collection offers students a chance to use readable primary sources to research details of the everyday lives of Southern slaves.</p><p><i> Alice Conlon, University of Houston</i></p><p>Copyright 1989 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Intimate Merton: His Life from His Journals</h2><p><p>In this diary-like memoir, composed of his most poignant and insightful journal entries, <em>The Intimate Merton</em> lays bare the steep ways of Thomas Merton's spiritual path. Culled from the seven volumes of his personal journals, this twenty nine year chronicle deepens and extends the story Thomas Merton recounted and made famous in <em>The Seven Storey Mountain.</em> This book is the spiritual autobiography of our century's most celebrated monk -- the wisdom gained from the personal experience of an enduring spiritual teacher. Here is Merton's account of his life's major challenges, his confrontations with monastic and church hierarchies, his interaction with religious traditions east and west, and his antiwar and civil-rights activities. In <em>The Intimate Merton</em> we engage a writer's art of "confession and witness" as he searches for a contemporary, authentic, and global spirituality.</p><p>Recounting Merton's earliest days in the monastery to his journey east to meet the Dalai Lama, <em>The Intimate Merton</em> captures the essence of what makes Thomas Merton's life journey so perennially relevant.</p></p><p>If you like your saints packaged without the messiness of an actual error-filled life, this book is not for you. If, however, you want a glimpse inside the mind and spirit of a splendid writer and thinker who tried live his life as honestly as he could as a journey into God, then this is a grace-filled beauty. Subtitled "His Life from His Journals," these selections--dating from 1939 (before he entered the monastery) to 1968 (within days of his death)--remind us how much of Merton's life unfolded precisely in and through his own writing--how he made himself through his writing. As he says, "it seems to me that writing, far from being an obstacle to spiritual perfection in my own life, has become one of the conditions on which my perfection will depend." Merton contends that writing--honest writing--is his way to move more and more deeply into the truth. In these very honest pages, covering everything from his meeting with the Dalai Lama to his experience of falling in love (25 years after entering the monastery), Truth unfolds itself through the act of writing. These pages are a thread into the center of that labyrinth, which is where he meets his God. Now we're invited along for the ride. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) is widely regarded as one of the most influential spiritual writers of modern times. He was a Trappist monk, writer, and peace and civil rights activist. His bestselling books include <em>The Seven-Storey Mountain, New Seeds of Contemplation,</em> and <em>Mystics and Zen Masters.</em> </p></p><h2>Supercharging Quantum-Touch: Advanced Techniques</h2><p>Quantum-Touch teaches ways to focus and amplify life-force energy <i>(chi) </i>through simple breathing and body awareness exercises.

Some passages encouraged women to be submissive and remain silent. Yet in others, women characters owned property, headed households, or spoke with approval. <em>Women in the New Testament World</em> helps readers understand this conflicting evidence. It argues that social norms of the time encouraged traditional feminine virtues. However, as Susan Hylen argues, women in the culture enacted these virtues in a variety of ways, including active leadership in households, associations, and cities. In contrast to earlier approaches that divided the evidence into groups that either allowed or forbade women's leadership, this book points to a tension that was pervasive across different groups and regions of the Roman world. Society widely viewed women as inferior to men yet applauded their active pursuit of familial and civic interests. Thus, it was not the case that some women led while others were silent; instead, women were praised for modesty at the same time as they exerted influence in their communities. Elaborating on this rich historical background, Hylen illuminates new possibilities in New Testament texts.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan E. Hylen </strong>is Associate Professor of New Testament at Candler School of Theology, Emory University. She is the author of four books, including <em>A Modest Apostle: Thecla and the History of Women in the Early Church.</em><br><br>"<em>Women in the New Testament World</em> is suggested for anyone seeking to better understand the world that women lived in during the composition of the New Testament. Many of the chapters promptly address the common assumptions regarding women in the first centuries, systematically opposing them in a wellorganized and thoughtful manner. The brevity of the work only heightens the achievement. The amount of content packed into such a small volume is a feat in itself. Hylen's work will serve as a standard introductory primer in classrooms that are interested in addressing gender issues in the ancient world." -- T. G. Barkasy, <em>Reading Religion </em><p></p><br>"Susan Hylen's new book is not another study of the literary portraits of New Testament women, but rather an in-depth exploration of the social world in which these real women lived and these literary figures are portrayed. It lays out methods and interpretive problems, presents evidence, and walks the reader through the conflicting ideals and reports that come to us from that world. An excellent resource for the interested general reader."--Carolyn Osiek, Professor Emerita, Brite Divinity School<p></p><br></p><h2>The Young Child and Mathematics</h2><p>This second edition of The Young Child and Mathematics reflects on recent developments in math education through vignettes, activity ideas, and strategies for teaching young children about math processes and concepts. Using standards and guidelines from NCTM) and NAEYC, Juanita Copley shows how teachers can readily and enjoyably make mathematics an integral part of their classrooms all day, every day.<br><br>Includes a DVD of print and video resources, including clips of the author in action in real classrooms, engaging young children in math thinking and learning.</p><p>Juanita Copley is a professor emerita at the University of Houston. She has taught middle school mathematics in the public schools, served as a mathematics specialist in two urban school districts, and taught math education courses at the University of Houston. She currently spends at least one day a week teaching in prekindergarten and elementary school classrooms. For more than a decade, Dr. Copley directed the innovative Early Childhood Mathematics Collaborative, a professional development project that has trained more than 2,000 preservice teachers and 250 inservice teachers. She has also worked with the Head Start Bureau in developing a mathematics initiative for teachers and young children. As professor emerita, she continues to devote much of her time and energy to professional development in early mathematics teaching. Dr. Copley has written and edited a number of books about early childhood mathematics, three of which are copublications of NAEYC and NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics). Her research on early childhood math and on effectiveness of professional development models for teachers in mathematics has been published in journals and presented at national early childhood and mathematics education conferences.The Young Child and Mathematics focuses on children from age 3 through 8 and their mathematical learning. The placement of the phrase young child before the word mathematics in the book&#x2019;s title is not accidental. It comes first because I believe that the child should be the focus of early education. In this chapter I share some of the lessons that I have learned about children and their understanding of mathematics. Some of my ideas about how to teach mathematics come from textbooks, some from watching other teachers teach, and some from experts. However, most, if not all, of the ideas were greatly influenced by children themselves. In some cases their strategies changed the activities for my lessons, their interests changed the scope of the content, or their particular strengths or weaknesses changed the sequence of my instruction. Whatever the case, I have found that when I make the child the focus of my teaching, I teach mathematics well.</p><h2>Stagecraft Fundamentals: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production</h2><p><i> </i><p><i>Stagecraft Fundamentals</i> tackles every aspect of basic theatre production with Rita Kogler Carver&#x2019;s signature wit and engaging voice.

Dr Winter looks anew at the culture of commemoration and the ways in which communities endeavoured to find collective solace after 1918. Taking issue with the prevailing &#39;modernist&#39; interpretation of the European reaction to the appalling events of 1914-18, Dr Winter instead argues that what characterised that reaction was, rather, the attempt to interpret the Great War within traditional frames of reference. Tensions arose inevitably.

It is a useful reference work for beginning students, but also explores the central themes of Being and Time with a depth that will be of interest to scholars. The Companion begins with a section-by-section overview of Being and Time and a chapter reviewing the genesis of this seminal work. The final chapter situates Being and Time in the context of Heidegger&#39;s later work. The remaining chapters examine the core issues of Being and Time, including the question of being, the phenomenology of space, the nature of human being (our relation to others, the importance of moods, the nature of human understanding, language), Heidegger&#39;s views on idealism and realism and his position on skepticism and truth, Heidegger&#39;s account of authenticity (with a focus on his views on freedom, being toward death, and resoluteness), and the nature of temporality and human historicality.</p><p>Martin Heidegger&#39;s Being and Time is one of the most influential and revolutionary books in the history of philosophy. It is also, notoriously, one of the most difficult to understand. This Companion will help beginners grasp what Being and Time achieves, and will illustrate what is at stake in Heidegger&#39;s existential and phenomenological take on the central issues in the Western tradition of philosophy. The essays in this volume also engage with scholarly debates over the core arguments of Heidegger&#39;s seminal works.Dr Mark A.

Crow&#39;s classic study of the cultural history of Spain and its people, which he last updated in 1985 but which seems as fresh and pertinent as when he first wrote it. Crow devoted a lifetime to Hispanic studies and here provides a historical interpretation of Spanish civilization from its earliest beginnings to the present. The scope of this study is remarkable and includes chapters on Roman Spain, the Jews in Spain, the Moors, life in medieval towns, and the Golden Age of Spain, plus a view of Franco&#39;s legacy.</p><p><b>John A. Crow</b> was Professor Emeritus of Spanish at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was also author of <i>The Epic of Latin America </i>(fourth edition, California, 1992).PRAISE FOR THE PREVIOUS EDITION: &#34;The distinctive features of the book are indeed the author&#39;s deep insight into the mores of the country, the fundamental psychology of the Spanish people as shared by geography and history, and his enthusiasm for the brilliance of Spain&#39;s culture, which has at all times dwarfed the political ephemera. The essential political facts are all there, but far more important and meaningful--to him and to us--is the environmental lore that Dr. Crow has gleaned from his many journeys since he first went to Spain in 1928: wisdom and understanding which he now distills for us in a lively idiom that is in the best tradition of humane Hispanists.&#34;--&#34;Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>Principles of Animal Behavior, 4th Edition</h2><p>Since the last edition of this definitive textbook was published in 2013, much has happened in the field of animal behavior. In this fourth edition, Lee Alan Dugatkin draws on cutting-edge new work not only to update and expand on the studies presented, but also to reinforce the previous editions&#x2019; focus on ultimate and proximate causation, as well as the book&#x2019;s unique emphasis on natural selection, learning, and cultural transmission. The result is a state-of-the-art textbook on animal behavior that explains underlying concepts in a way that is both scientifically rigorous and accessible to students. Each chapter in the book provides a sound theoretical and conceptual basis upon which the empirical studies rest. A completely new feature in this edition are the Cognitive Connection boxes in Chapters 2&#x2013;17, designed to dig deep into the importance of the cognitive underpinnings to many types of behaviors. Each box focuses on a specific issue related to cognition and the particular topic covered in that chapter.<br><br> As <i>Principles of Animal Behavior</i> makes clear, the tapestry of animal behavior is created from weaving all of these components into a beautiful whole. With Dugatkin&#x2019;s exquisitely illustrated, comprehensive, and up-to-date fourth edition, we are able to admire that beauty anew.</p><p><b>Lee Alan Dugatkin</b> is an animal behaviorist, evolutionary biologist, and historian of science in the Department of Biology at the University of Louisville.

Her relentless affairs, wild sex parties, and brazen flaunting of convention shocked high society and inspired countless writers and artists, from Nancy Mitford to Greta Garbo. But Idina&#x2019;s compelling charm masked the pain of betrayal and heartbreak. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now Frances Osborne explores the life of Idina, her enigmatic great-grandmother, using letters, diaries, and family legend, following her from Edwardian London to the hills of Kenya, where she reigned over the scandalous antics of the &#x201c;Happy Valley Set.&#x201d; Dazzlingly chic yet warmly intimate, <i>The Bolter </i>is a fascinating look at a woman whose energy still burns bright almost a century later.</p><p>Frances Osborne was born in London and studied philosophy and modern languages at Oxford University. She is the author of <i>Lilla&#x2019;s Feast.</i> Her articles have appeared in <i>The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Independent, </i>the <i>Daily Mail, </i>and <i>Vogue.</i> She lives in London with her husband, a Member of Parliament, and their two children.Chapter 1<br><br>Thirty years after her death, Idina entered my life like a bolt of electricity. Spread across the top half of the front page of the Review section of the <i>Sunday Times</i> was a photograph of a woman standing encircled by a pair of elephant tusks, the tips almost touching above her head. She was wearing a drop-waisted silk dress, high-heeled shoes, and a felt hat with a large silk flower perching on its wide, undulating brim. Her head was almost imperceptibly tilted, chin forward, and although the top half of her face was shaded it felt as if she was looking straight at me. I wanted to join her on the hot, dry African dust, still stainingly rich red in this black-and-white photograph.<br><br>I was not alone. For she was, the newspaper told me, irresistible. Five foot three, slight, girlish, yet always dressed for the Faubourg Saint-Honor�, she dazzled men and women alike. Not conventionally beautiful, on account of a &#x201c;shotaway chin,&#x201d; she could nonetheless &#x201c;whistle a chap off a branch.&#x201d; After sunset, she usually did.<br><br>The <i>Sunday Times</i> was running the serialization of a book, <i>White Mischief</i>, about the murder of a British aristocrat, the Earl of Erroll, in Kenya during the Second World War. He was only thirty-nine when he was killed. He had been only twenty-two, with seemingly his whole life ahead of him, when he met this woman. He was a golden boy, the heir to a historic earldom and one of Britain&#x2019;s most eligible bachelors. She was a twice-divorced thirty-year-old, who, when writing to his parents, called him &#x201c;the child.&#x201d; One of them proposed in Venice. They married in 1924, after a two-week engagement.<br><br>Idina had then taken him to live in Kenya, where their lives dissolved into a round of house parties, drinking, and nocturnal wandering. She had welcomed her guests as she lay in a green onyx bath, then dressed in front of them. She made couples swap partners according to who blew a feather across a sheet at whom, and other games. At the end of the weekend she stood in front of the house to bid them farewell as they bundled into their cars. Clutching a dog and waving, she called out a husky, &#x201c;Good-bye, my darlings, come again soon,&#x201d; as though they had been to no more than a children&#x2019;s tea party.<br><br>Idina&#x2019;s bed, however, was known as &#x201c;the battleground.&#x201d; She was, said James Fox, the author of<i> White Mischief</i>, the &#x201c;high priestess&#x201d; of the miscreant group of settlers infamously known as the Happy Valley crowd. And she married and divorced a total of five times.<br>IT WAS NOVEMBER 1982. I was thirteen years old and transfixed. Was this the secret to being irresistible to men, to behave as this woman did, while &#x201c;walking barefoot at every available opportunity&#x201d; as well<br><br>as being &#x201c;intelligent, well-read, enlivening company&#x201d;? My younger sister&#x2019;s infinitely curly hair brushed my ear. She wanted to read the article too. Prudishly, I resisted. Kate persisted, and within a minute we were at the dining room table, the offending article in Kate&#x2019;s hand. My father looked at my mother, a grin spreading across his face, a twinkle in his eye.<br><br>&#x201c;You have to tell them,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>My mother flushed.<br><br>&#x201c;You really do,&#x201d; he nudged her on.<br><br>Mum swallowed, and then spoke. As the words tumbled out of her mouth, the certainties of my childhood vanished into the adult world of family falsehoods and omissions. Five minutes earlier I had been reading a newspaper, awestruck at a stranger&#x2019;s exploits. Now I could already feel my great-grandmother&#x2019;s long, manicured fingernails resting on my forearm as I wondered which of her impulses might surface in me.<br><br>&#x201c;Why did you keep her a secret?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Because&#x201d;&#x2014;my mother paused&#x2014;&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want you to think her a role model.

You don&#x2019;t want to be known as &#x2018;the Bolter&#x2019;s&#x2019; granddaughter.&#x201d;<br><br>MY MOTHER WAS RIGHT to be cautious: Idina and her blackened reputation glistened before me. In an age of wicked women she had pushed the boundaries of behavior to extremes. Rather than simply mirror the exploits of her generation, Idina had magnified them. While her fellow Edwardian debutantes in their crisp white dresses merely contemplated daring acts, Idina went everywhere with a jet- black Pekinese called Satan. In that heady prewar era rebounding with dashing young millionaires&#x2014;scions of industrial dynasties&#x2014;Idina had married just about the youngest, handsomest, richest one. &#x201c;Brownie,&#x201d; she called him, calling herself &#x201c;Little One&#x201d; to him: &#x201c;Little One extracted a large pearl ring&#x2014;by everything as only she knows how,&#x201d; she wrote in his diary.<br><br>When women were more sophisticated than we can even imagine now, she was, despite her small stature, famous for her seamless elegance. In the words of<i> The New York Times</i>, Idina was &#x201c;well known in London Society, particularly for her ability to wear beautiful clothes.&#x201d; It was as if looking that immaculate allowed her to behave as disreputably as she did. For, having reached the heights of wealth and glamour at an early age, Idina fell from grace. In the age of the flappers that followed the First World War, she danced, stayed out all night, and slept around more noticeably than her fellows. When the sexual scandals of Happy Valley gripped the world&#x2019;s press, Idina was at the heart of them. When women were making bids for independence and divorcing to marry again, Idina did so&#x2014;not just once, but several times over. As one of her many in-laws told me, &#x201c;It was an age of bolters, but Idina was by far the most celebrated.&#x201d;<br><br>She &#x201c;lit up a room when she entered it,&#x201d; wrote one admirer, &#x201c;D.D.,&#x201d; in the <i>Times</i> after her death. &#x201c;She lived totally in the present,&#x201d; said a girlfriend in 2004, who asked, even after all these years, to remain anonymous, for &#x201c;Idina was a darling, but she was naughty.&#x201d; A portrait of Idina by William Orpen shows a pair of big blue eyes looking up excitedly, a flicker of a pink-red pouting lip stretching into a sideways grin. A tousle of tawny hair frames a face that, much to the irritation of her peers, she didn&#x2019;t give a damn whether she sunburnt or not. &#x201c;The fabulous Idina Sackville,&#x201d; wrote Idina&#x2019;s lifelong friend the travel writer Rosita Forbes, was &#x201c;smooth, sunburned, golden&#x2014;tireless and gay&#x2014;she was the best travelling companion I have ever had . . .&#x201d; and bounded with &#x201c;all the Brassey vitality&#x201d; of her mother&#x2019;s family. Deep in the Congo with Rosita, Idina, &#x201c;who always imposed civilization in the most contradictory of circumstances, produced ice out of a thermos bottle, so that we could have cold drinks with our lunch in the jungle.&#x201d;<br><br>There was more to Idina, however, than being &#x201c;good to look at and good company.&#x201d; She was a woman with a deep need to be loved and give love in return. &#x201c;Apart from the difficulty of keeping up with her husbands,&#x201d; continued Rosita, Idina &#x201c;made a habit of marrying whenever she fell in love . . . She was a delight to her friends.&#x201d;<br><br>Idina had a profound sense of friendship. Her female friendships lasted far longer than any of her marriages. She was not a husband stealer. And above all, wrote Rosita, &#x201c;she was preposterously&#x2014;and secretly&#x2014;kind.&#x201d;<br><br>As my age and wisdom grew fractionally, my fascination with Idina blossomed exponentially. She had been a cousin of the writer Vita Sackville-West, but rather than write herself, Idina appears to have been written about. Her life was uncannily reflected in the writer Nancy Mitford&#x2019;s infamous character &#x201c;the Bolter,&#x201d; the narrator&#x2019;s errant mother in<i> The Pursuit of Love, Love in a Cold Climate</i>, and <i>Don&#x2019;t Tell Alfred</i>. The similarities were strong enough to haunt my mother and her sister, two of Idina&#x2019;s granddaughters. When they were seventeen and eighteen, fresh off the Welsh farm where they had been brought up, they were dispatched to London to be debutantes in a punishing round of dances, drinks parties, and designer dresses. As the two girls made their first tentative steps into each party, their waists pinched in Bellville Sassoon ball dresses, a whisper would start up and follow them around the room that they were &#x201c;the Bolter&#x2019;s granddaughters,&#x201d; as though they, too, might suddenly remove their clothes.<br><br>In the novels, Nancy Mitford&#x2019;s much-married Bolter fled to Kenya, where she embroiled herself in &#x201c;hot stuff . . . including horse- whipping and the aeroplane&#x201d; and a white hunter or two as a husband, although nobody is quite sure which ones she actually married. The fictional Bolter&#x2019;s daughter lives, as Idina&#x2019;s real daughter did, in England with her childless aunt, spending the holidays with an eccentric uncle and his children. When the Bolter eventually appears at her brother&#x2019;s house, she looks immaculate, despite having walked across half a continent. With her is her latest companion, the much younger, non-English-speaking Juan, whom she has picked up in Spain. The Bolter leaves Juan with her brother while she goes to stay at houses to which she cannot take him. &#x201c; &#x2018;If I were the Bolter,&#x2019; &#x201d; Mitford puts into the Bolter&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s mouth, &#x201c; &#x2018;I would marry him.&#x2019; &#x2018;Knowing the Bolter,&#x2019; said Davey, &#x2018;she probably will.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Like the Bolter, Idina famously dressed to perfection, whatever the circumstances. After several weeks of walking and climbing in the jungle with Rosita, she sat, cross-legged, looking &#x201c;as if she had just come out of tissue paper.&#x201d; And her scandals were manifold, including, perhaps unsurprisingly, a case of horsewhipping. She certainly married one pilot (husband number five) and almost married another. There was a white-hunter husband who, somewhat inconveniently, tried to shoot anyone he thought might be her lover. And, at one stage, she found an Emmanuele in Portugal and drove him right across the Sahara and up to her house in Kenya. He stayed for several months, returning the same way to Europe and Idina&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s house. Idina then set off on her tour of the few British houses in which she was still an acceptable guest, leaving the uninvited Emmanuele behind. This boyfriend, however, she did not marry.<br><br>Even before that, the writer Michael Arlen had changed her name from Idina Sackville to Iris Storm, who was the tragic heroine of his best- selling portrait of the 1920s, <i>The Green Hat</i>, played by Garbo in <i>A Woman of Affairs</i>, the silent movie version of the book. Idina had been painted by Orpen and photographed by Beaton. Molyneux designed some of the first ever slinky, wraparound dresses for her, and her purchases in Paris were reported throughout the American press. When Molyneux had financial difficulties, Idina helped bail him out. In return he would send her some of each season&#x2019;s collection, delicately ruffled silk dresses and shirts, in which she would lounge around the stone-and-timber shack of the Gilgil Club.<br><br>A FARM HALFWAY UP an African mountain is not the usual place to find such an apparently tireless pleasure-seeker as Idina. Clouds was by no means a shack: by African mountain standards it was a palace, made all the more striking by the creature comforts that Idina&#x2014;who had designed and built the house&#x2014;managed to procure several thousand feet above sea level. It was nonetheless a raw environment. Lethal leopard and lion, elephant and buffalo, roamed around the grounds of its working farm, where &#x201c;Idina had built up one of the strongest dairy herds in Africa,&#x201d; according to a fellow farmer who used to buy stock from her. Idina took farming immensely seriously, surprising the Kenyans who worked for her with her appetite for hard work. Like them, too, she camped out on safari for weeks on end. But then, as Rosita put it, Idina &#x201c;was an extraordinary mixture of sybarite and pioneer.&#x201d;<br><br>Up at Clouds, Idina filled her dining table with everyone visiting the house. She made no distinction between her friends and the people working for her, &#x201c;including the chap who came to mend the gramophone etc.&#x201d; The gin flowed. She was &#x201c;always most hospitable . . . absolutely charming and put one completely at one&#x2019;s ease and I was bowled over by her,&#x201d; wrote an acquaintance.<br><br>However, behind this hard work and high living lay a deep sadness.<br><br>When the poet Fr�d�ric de Janz� described his friends (and enemies) in Kenya alphabetically, for Idina he wrote: &#x201c;I is for Idina, fragile and frail.&#x201d; When Idina is described, sometimes critically, as living &#x201c;totally in the present,&#x201d; it should be remembered that her past was not necessarily a happy place. Driving her wild life, and her second, third, fourth, and fifth marriages, was the ghost of a decision Idina made back in 1918, which had led to that fall from grace. On the day the First World War ended, she had written to her young, handsome, extremely rich first husband, Euan Wallace, and asked for a divorce. She then left him to go and live in Africa with a second husband, in comparison with Euan a penniless man. She went in search of something that she hadn&#x2019;t found with Euan. And when, not long after, that second marriage collapsed, Idina was left to go on searching. In the words of Michael Arlen&#x2019;s Iris Storm, &#x201c;There is one taste in us that is unsatisfied. I don&#x2019;t know what that taste is, but I know it is there. Life&#x2019;s best gift, hasn&#x2019;t someone said, is the ability to dream of a better life.&#x201d;<br><br>Idina dreamt of that better life. Whenever she reinvented her life with a new husband, she believed that, this time round, she could make it happen. Yet that better life remained frustratingly just out of reach. Eventually she found the courage to stop and look back. But, by then, it was too late.<br><br>When she died, openly professing, &#x201c;I should never have left Euan,&#x201d; she had a photograph of him beside her bed. Thirty years after that first divorce she had just asked that one of her grandsons&#x2014;through another marriage&#x2014;bear his name. Her daughter, the boy&#x2019;s mother, who had never met the ex-husband her mother was talking about, obliged.<br><br>At the end of her life, Idina had clearly continued to love Euan Wallace deeply. Yet she had left him. Why?<br><br>The question would not leave me.</p><h2>Winston Churchill&#39;s War Leadership</h2><p>How does he assess the information that is brought to him? How does his personal or political philosophy, or a moral sense, sustain him? How does he draw inspiration from those around him? How does he deal with setbacks and disasters? In this brilliant close-up look at Winston Churchill's leadership during the Second World War, Gilbert gets to the heart of the trials and struggles that have confronted the world's most powerful leaders, even up to current politicians such as George Bush and Tony Blair.<br><br>Basing the book on his intimate knowledge of Churchill's private and official papers, Sir Martin Gilbert, Churchill&#x2019;s official biographer, looks at the public figure and wartime propaganda, to reveal a very human, sensitive, and often tormented man, who nevertheless found the strength to lead his nation forward from the darkest and most dangerous of times.</p><p>Sir Martin Gilbert is Winston Churchill's official biographer and a leading historian of the modern world. He is the author of seventy-three books, among them <b>Churchill: A Life</b>, comprehensive studies of both the First and Second World Wars, and his three-volume work <b>A History of the Twentieth Century</b><i>.</i> He was made an Honorary Fellow of Merton College, Oxford, in 1994 and was knighted in 1995. He lives in London with his wife Susan and their two boys.When Winston Churchill beccame Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, he had been a Member of Parliament for almost forty years. For more than twenty-five of those years he had held high ministerial office, with responsibilities that covered many spheres of national policy and international affairs. Central to the strength of his war leadership was this experience. Churchill could draw upon knowledge acquired in the many fierce political battles and tough international negotiations in which he had been a central and often successful participant. "My knowledge, which has been bought, not taught," was how he expressed it in the House of Commons during a stormy interwar debate on defence. <br><br>Churchill's knowledge had often been bought at the price of unpopularity and failure. But, above all, it was the experience of dealing, both as a Cabinet Minister from 1905 and as a member of the Committee of Imperial Defence from 1909, with a wide range of national and world issues, and also of persuading a frequently hostile House of Commons to accept the logic and argument of government policy. That experience served as an essential underpinning-and strengthening-of his leadership in the Second World War. For a decade before the First World War, four Prime Ministers-Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, Lloyd George and Baldwin-each entrusted Churchill with contentious issues, having a high regard for his negotiating and persuasive skills. The experience he gained was considerable. In 1911 he had been a pioneer of industrial conciliation and arbitration at a time of intense labour unrest. In 1913 he had led the search for an amelioration of Anglo-German naval rivalry. In 1914 his duties as First Lord of the Admiralty (the post he was to hold again on the outbreak of war in 1939) included both the air defence of London and the protection of the Royal Navy and merchant shipping from German naval attack. In 1917 he was put in charge of munitions production in Britain at a time of the greatest need and strain. In 1919 he devised, as a matter of urgency, a system of demobilization that calmed the severe tensions of a disaffected soldiery. In the early 1920s he had been at the centre of resolving the demands of Irish Catholics for Home Rule and of the first-and effectively the last-border delineation dispute between Southern Ireland and Ulster. At the same time, he had undertaken the complicated task of carrying out Britain's promise to the Jews of a National Home in Palestine after the First World War.<br><br>This experience of dealing at the centre with Britain's major national needs, during more than three decades, gave Churchill a precious boon from the first days of his premiership. It also provided him with many specific pointers to war direction. A quarter of a century before he became Prime Minister, he had seen the perils that accompanied the evolution of war policy when there was no central direction. He had been a member of the War Council in 1914, when the Prime Minister, Asquith, had been unable to exercise effective control over the two Service departments-the army and the navy. To redress this problem, on becoming Prime Minister in May 1940, Churchill created the post, hitherto unknown in Britain, of Minister of Defence. Although the new Ministry had no departmental structure as such, it did have a secretariat, headed by General Hastings Ismay, who served, with his small staff, as a direct conduit between the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff-the respective heads of the army, navy and air force. This structure enabled Churchill to put forward his suggestions directly, and with the utmost directness, to those who would have to accept or reject, modify and implement them. <br><br>The organization of his wartime premiership was a central feature of Churchill's war leadership. That organization took several months to perfect, but from his first days as Prime Minister and Minister of Defence he worked to establish it, and to create in the immediate ambit of 10 Downing Street an organization that would give the nation strong and effective leadership. At its core was the close relationship between Churchill and the three Chiefs of Staff. Their frequent meetings, often daily, enabled him to discuss with them the many crises of the war, to tackle the many emergencies, and to decide on an acceptable common strategy. Working under the Chiefs of Staff, and in close association with Churchill through the Ministry of Defence, were two other essential instruments of military planning: the Joint Planning Staff (known as the "Joint Planners") and the Joint Intelligence Committee. <br><br>Other essential elements of the organizational side of Churchill's war leadership evolved as the need arose, among them the Production Council, the Import Executive, the Tank Parliament, the Combined Raw Materials Board (an Anglo-America venture), the Anglo-American Shipping Adjustment Board, and the Battle of the Atlantic Committee of the War Cabinet. And always to hand was the apparatus of Intelligence gathering, assessment and distribution, controlled by the Secret Intelligence Services headed by Colonel (later General) Stewart Menzies, with whom Churchill was in daily communication. In his Minutes to Menzies, Churchill made whatever comments he felt were needed on the nature, implications and circulation of Intelligence material. <br><br>This organizational structure gave Churchill a method of war leadership whereby the highest possible accumulation of professional knowledge was at his disposal. He was not a dictatorial leader, although he could be emphatic in his requests and suggestions. If the Chiefs of Staff opposed any initiative he proposed, it was abandoned. He had no power to overrule their collective will. But on most occasions there was no such stark dichotomy. He and they were searching for the same out-come-the means, first, to avert defeat; then to contain and, finally, to defeat Germany-and in this search they were in frequent agreement. <br><br>One of the members of Churchill's Private Office, John Peck, later recalled: "I have the clearest possible recollection of General Ismay talking to me about a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff Committee at which they got completely stuck and admitted that they just did not know what was the right course to pursue; so on a purely military matter, they had come to Churchill, civilian, for his advice. He introduced some further facts into the equation that had escaped their notice and the solution became obvious." <br><br>A crucial aspect of Churchill's war leadership was his private secretariat, the Private Office at 10 Downing Street. Members of his Private Office accompanied him wherever he went, whether in Britain or overseas, and were available to help smooth his path during every working hour, often until late into the night. At its centre were his Private Secretaries: civil servants, mostly in their thirties, who remained at his side on a rota system throughout the week and the weekend. They were privy to his innermost thoughts (although not, ironically, to the decrypted Enigma messages on which so many of those thoughts hinged). They knew how to interpret his briefest of instructions, some of which were scarcely more than a grunt or a nod of the head. They knew how to find documents and to circulate them. They kept his desk diary with its myriad appointments. They also ensured that whatever the Prime Minister needed-a document to study, a file to scrutinize, a colleague to question, a journey to be organized, a foreign dignitary to be received-all was ready at the right time and in the right place. Given the scale of Churchill's travel in Britain and overseas, and his notorious unpunctuality and indecision in little things, this streamlined operation was impressive. In a private letter to General Sir Bernard Montgomery, Clementine Churchill referred to her husband's "chronic unpunctuality" and "habit of changing his mind (in little things) every minute!" For example, his Private Secretariat was caused endless vexation as to whether he would receive some important visitor at 10 Downing Street, at No. 10 Annexe a hundred yards away, or in the Prime Minister's room in the House of Commons. <br><br>Churchill could also show uncertainty regarding the large decisions, rehearsing them in his mind and hesitating for long periods before settling on a course of action. One such instance was the difficult decision, which he supported, to send British troops to Greece to take part in the defence of that country against a possible German attack, thus weakening the British forces that were then defending Egypt. In the end, he asked for every member of his War Cabinet to vote on this matter. The unanimous vote was in favour of showing Greece that she was not to be abandoned by her ally, despite the hopelessness of the situation, given German military superiority. <br><br>The names of most of the members of Churchill's Private Office are little known to history. Only one, John Colville-who started as the Junior Private Secretary in 1940-subsequently made his mark, one of great importance to history, because he kept a detailed diary (quite against the rules) of those days when he was on duty. Neither the first Principal Private Secretary, Eric Seal, nor Seal's successor John Martin, nor the other members of the Private Office-John Peck, Christopher Dodds and Leslie Rowan-kept anything more than a few jottings and private letters. The whole team constituted, collectively, the support system on which Churchill depended and from whom he obtained first-class service, ensuring the smooth running of the prime ministerial enterprise at its centre. The members of his Private Office sustained him without publicity or fanfare, but with a professionalism and a devotion that helped to make his leadership both smooth and effective.</p><h2>Water Walker (Outlaw Chronicles)</h2><p><p><b>"My name is Alice Ringwald, but the man who kidnapped me says that's a lie."</b></p> <p>Thirteen-year-old orphan Alice Ringwald has no memory beyond six months ago.

The bigger-is-better idea that triggered the explosion of McMansions has spilled over to give us McLives&#x2013;leaving us with chaotic, overcommitted schedules and no time to do what we want to do. <br><br>In <i>The Not So Big Life</i>, architect Sarah Susanka expands her revolutionary philosophy on inhabiting space to show us how to better inhabit our lives. Through simple exercises and inspiring stories, Susanka reveals that all we need to do is make small shifts in our day&#x2013;subtle movements that open our minds as if we were opening windows to let in fresh air. The result: We quickly discover that we have all the space and time we need for the things in our lives that really matter. These small changes can yield great rewards. In her elegant, clear style, Susanka convinces us that less is truly more&#x2013;much more.</p><p>Sarah Susanka is a bestselling author, architect, and cultural visionary.

Don&#x2019;t open the door to the study<br>and begin reading. Take down a musical instrument.<br>Let the beauty we love be what we do.<br>There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.<br>&#x2014;RUMI<br><br>What Are We Missing?<br><br>We are facing an enormous problem in our lives today. It&#x2019;s so big we can hardly see it, and it&#x2019;s right in our face all day, every day. We&#x2019;re all living too big lives, crammed from top to toe with activities, urgencies, and obligations that seem absolute. There&#x2019;s no time to take a breath, no time to look for the source of the problem. We are almost desperate for a solution. If we stop and consider what our lives would be like if things got much faster, we might feel overwhelmed by hopelessness and futility. We just don&#x2019;t have any more to give. We&#x2019;re at the end of our rope.<br><br>We need to remodel the way we are living, but not in a way that gives us more of the same kinds of space we already have; that would simply create an even bigger life. What we need is a remodeling that allows us to experience what&#x2019;s already here but to experience it differently, so that it delights us rather than drives us crazy.<br><br>Your life is a lot like the house you live in. It has some things that you like and some that you find irritating. It has rooms that are used constantly and others that you visit only once in a blue moon. It has features that need frequent maintenance and others that will last for decades without your attention. Almost all of us would engage in some remodeling of our house if we had the time and the money. In an ideal world all the shortcomings of our home would be remodeled to fit the way we&#x2019;d like to live, with plenty of room for the things we hold most dear.<br><br>The real issue is that we want to feel at home both in our houses and in our lives, and we try to do this by tweaking the things we are aware of, the things we assume must be the problem, such as not enough space and not enough time. But some problems are less visible; they&#x2019;re about qualities rather than quantities, so they are more difficult to identify, articulate, and resolve. We can&#x2019;t create more of a sense of home if we don&#x2019;t understand where that feeling comes from. In your house, for example, if you feel upset every time you return home from work because you have to enter through the laundry room, pushing your way past baskets of clothes waiting to be washed, unfolded mounds of sheets and towels, and a miscellaneous trail of kids&#x2019; coats and boots, you may require an architect to point out to you that yours is not a well-designed entry sequence. It&#x2019;s not the laundry itself that&#x2019;s the problem; it&#x2019;s that you have to pass through it to enter the house.<br><br>Our lives are just the same. We think the problem is our job or our boss or our child care arrangement or our spouse, and we keep trying to fix those things, only to find new frustrations popping up once we get free of the offending situation, making it impossible for us to feel at home in our lives. The problem isn&#x2019;t what we think it is. Like the process of identifying that it&#x2019;s the entry sequence that takes you through the laundry and not the laundry itself that&#x2019;s the problem, fixing the problems in our lives involves understanding what underlies these events. What&#x2019;s needed is a dramatic shift in perspective, and architecture and design provide remarkably useful metaphors for helping us to see what that shift might look like.<br><br>When you remodel a house, you don&#x2019;t need to change a lot of things in order to shift the character of the house, but you do need to evaluate what isn&#x2019;t working and determine what you would like to have room for but don&#x2019;t. Then you need to compose a good design solution that uses what already exists but modifies it here and there to accommodate the new functions. After that you must develop a thorough set of blueprints that record all the decisions made. And finally, to live the changes, you must build. This last step may seem obvious, but it&#x2019;s actually the easiest to miss. No amount of planning will bring about change. It&#x2019;s the actual implementation that allows things to shift.<br><br>In remodeling your life it&#x2019;s the same. You can read all manner of books and dream all manner of dreams, but only when you decide that you&#x2019;re really going to do something differently, and follow through with the implementation of those plans, will things begin to change. You have to start living what you&#x2019;ve learned, and not just on Saturday afternoons when you have some spare time. The lessons have to be woven into your everyday life and lived just as reflexively as the acts of washing your hands and brushing your teeth. Solving the problem has two parts: first, we need knowledge in order to see things in a new way; then, we need to integrate what we&#x2019;ve learned by being in our lives differently and doing things in a new way.<br><br>To accomplish a life remodeling, we need a blueprint, along with instructions for putting the plan into place in our lives. That&#x2019;s what this book offers you, the remodeler. When we&#x2019;re done, the contents of your days will still be quite recognizable to you, but there will be room to do what you&#x2019;ve always wanted to do and the freedom to experience more of the potential you know is waiting within you to be revealed and realized. If you engage the steps prescribed, integrating them as suggested, there will be change, and you will experience things differently, and with new vitality.<br><br>So how do we get there? Let&#x2019;s take a look at the key ingredients that go into the making of a Not So Big Life. These will serve as a thumbnail sketch for each of the plans we&#x2019;ll develop more fully in the chapters that follow.<br><br>one � Developing a Blueprint for a New Way of Living<br><br>Because we tend to compartmentalize our lives&#x2014;to see our working world as one thing, our home life as another, and our desire for connection with our inner nature as yet another&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t really live in the way we know should be possible.<br><br>This compartmentalizing is similar to the way we separate room from room with walls. A house that&#x2019;s full of separate rooms that are connected to one another only by narrow doorways can feel claustrophobic no matter how large the overall square footage. What gives a sense of space is the extent of the connecting views between rooms. The more you can see of an adjacent room, by opening up a wall with an archway or an interior window, the more spacious you&#x2019;ll feel the house to be.<br><br>In our lives we need to make the same kinds of connections between realms, removing the barriers to flow so that we can feel as alive and whole at work as we do when we are engaged in doing the things we love. What is needed is an integration of what we long for and what we work for. We don&#x2019;t have to sacrifice one for the other. Both can coexist in deeply satisfying harmony if we learn to understand ourselves better from the inside out.<br><br>two � Noticing What Inspires You<br><br>When I first begin working with architectural clients, I ask them to show me pictures from magazines or from other houses they know that delight them, as well as their favorite places in their own house. These are the features that will make them look forward to returning home each day, so they are really important to a sense of well-being and a sense of home.<br><br>For example, I remember one woman, a mother of three active boys, showing me a picture of a small alcove off a family room, with a comfortable wingback chair positioned to look out across the vista of prairie beyond. When I asked her what in particular she was responding to in the photograph, she told me that it was the promise of a time when she could do nothing more than sit and look, without any obligations, and without her to-do list nagging at her. The picture captured a quality of being that she was missing in her life. Such a place, when designed into her remodeled home, would inspire her to find this kind of time for herself.<br><br>Another client, a man in his late fifties who was the CEO of a midsize manufacturing company, showed me a dog-eared photograph of his grandmother&#x2019;s summer cabin&#x2014;a place where he&#x2019;d spent many happy sun-drenched months as a child. For him, the character of the structure, a simple clapboard house with no frills or embellishments, spoke to him of the calmness and ease he had felt during those summers. He wanted to replicate the form in his new home to remind him of that simplicity, even when the events in his life seemed anything but simple.<br><br>We can use this same approach in our lives by identifying the activities and engagements that have made us feel most alive. Almost anything can provide raw material for inspiration and for an expansion of who we take ourselves to be. All we need to do is recognize the places where we are most susceptible to their showing up and build into our regular lives the elements to support them, just as an architect builds in places that make you feel at home in your remodeled house.<br><br>three � Identifying What Isn&#x2019;t Working<br><br>Once my new clients have shown me what inspires them, I&#x2019;ll ask them to show me what isn&#x2019;t working in their existing home. This is where they&#x2019;ll take me from room to room, pointing out the problem areas. Often they&#x2019;ll refer to the awkward configuration of work surfaces in the kitchen, for example, and the lack of room for an island where others can sit while food is being prepared; but they won&#x2019;t realize that the kitchen&#x2019;s isolation from the main living area is at least as big a problem as any of the smaller issues they&#x2019;ve enumerated. An architect&#x2019;s job is to look beyond the obvious, beyond the stated problems, to the larger but often hidden issues underlying the overall configuration of the house.<br><br>Similarly, in our lives we can readily point to the things we&#x2019;d like to have time for, and we can rattle off a list of ways to do more efficiently what we have to do, so we can theoretically find time for the fun stuff; but, like the kitchen&#x2019;s isolation, we can&#x2019;t see that the real problem is not a lack of time but how we engage time in general. We think the problem is the way we&#x2019;re sequencing or managing what we&#x2019;re doing, when in fact it&#x2019;s the way we engage the doing itself. Like the architect for the kitchen remodeling, I&#x2019;ll be showing you some ways to look at things differently so that you can recognize the real obstacles to living a meaningful life.<br><br>four � Removing the Clutter<br><br>Almost every remodeling client I&#x2019;ve worked with has had at least a handful of secret stashes of clutter. They&#x2019;re not always obvious on first inspection, but dig a little&#x2014;open a closet, perhaps, or look under the bed&#x2014;and you&#x2019;ll find all sorts of old stuff that&#x2019;s no longer useful and now just takes up space and gathers dust bunnies. Most of these clients also have a few more apparent piles of unused detritus taking up space and making it difficult to get around while giving the impression that there&#x2019;s no room for anything new. In a house remodeling, these out-in-the-open piles are easy targets for removal in order to make the house feel bigger. But to remodel successfully, you also need to identify and sort through the hidden piles to make room for what&#x2019;s really supposed to go into those closets and drawers&#x2014; the stuff that&#x2019;s still useful and that plays an active role in present-day living.<br><br>In our lives we tend to see the frustrations with our jobs or our mates, but we can&#x2019;t see that the reasons we&#x2019;re frustrated with them emerge not from them but from some old conditionings from our childhood and early adulthood&#x2014;patterns that might have served us once but are no longer useful. These are the life equivalents of the hidden stashes under the bed or the pile of miscellaneous papers on the kitchen counter. Old patterns keep you locked into the way things have always been, unable to imagine what a small amount of remodeling can do. Here we&#x2019;ll be engaging a little psychology and a significant amount of self-observation. You&#x2019;ll discover that when you are given the right tools to work with, the materials for the remodeling of your life are delivered right to your doorstep every day.<br><br>five � Listening to Your Dreams<br><br>With my clients&#x2019; lists of likes and dislikes clearly in mind, I&#x2019;ll ask them to tell me more about what they long for. I tell them not to worry for the time being about whether they can afford these things. If I am to help them make their existing house into their dream home, I need to listen to everything they are willing to tell me about their true longings. It&#x2019;s not that they will be able to build exactly what their dreams suggest, but with a little interpretation I may be able to design some features they&#x2019;d never imagined possible on their budget.<br><br>For example, one client told me that in her dream house she would love to have a library, but she knew this was out of the question. Yet as I worked on the design, I realized that the wide hallway at the top of the stairs on the second floor could easily be lined with bookshelves, turning a space that was otherwise just for circulation into an ideal place for book storage. She was, of course, delighted. Had she never told me of her dream, the idea would never have occurred to me.<br><br>The same thing is true in our lives. If we tune out our dreams because we don&#x2019;t think they&#x2019;re possible, there&#x2019;s no chance they&#x2019;ll ever come into being because we won&#x2019;t be listening. Here I&#x2019;m talking not only about the dreams we have for our waking lives but also about the dreams from the realm of sleep. Whether or not you believe that dreams have anything to offer you, in a Not So Big Life you start to see that everything that enters your life contains meaning. They&#x2019;re like signposts directing you in the process of waking yourself up more fully to what&#x2019;s right in front of you.</p><h2>Thrive Foods: 200 Plant-Based Recipes for Peak Health</h2><p>"<i>Thrive Foods</i> offers a diet that's good for you and the planet."<b>- Washington Post</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>&nbsp;<br><b></b><b></b><b></b>"Brazier drills deep and delivers surprising news and statistics on the eating and production of food and how one person can make a big difference by eating plant-based meals."<b>- The Vancouver Sun</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>&nbsp;<br><b></b><b></b><b></b>"<i>Thrive Foods</i>&nbsp;will have you and your family brimming with energy and health."<b>- Reader's Digest</b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b><b></b>&nbsp;<br>* "This book will appeal to not only athletes and vegetarian but anyone who is concerned with eating to reduce personal and environmental stress.

Where does your&nbsp;food come from, and is it healthy? How can you be sure that you are receiving the nutrients you need? In <i>Thrive Foods</i>, Brazier clearly explains how nutrient-dense, plant-based foods are the best form of proactive health insurance and environmental sustainability rolled into one. And that's not all. Thrive Foods also features 200 nutritionally complete, easy-to-make recipes that utilize the power of super- foods such as maca, chia, hemp, and chlorella, and that avoid common allergens, such as wheat, yeast, gluten, soy, dairy, and corn.<br> &nbsp;<br> With recipes from celebrated chefs (Tal Ronnen, Chad Sarno, and others) and award-winning restaurants (such as Millennium and Candle 79), the healthy and delicious dishes include:<br> &nbsp;<br> Pumpkin Gnocchi | Italian Garden Stir Fry | Spicy Black Bean Chili | Quinoa Falafels | Chocolate Goodness Smoothie | Cool Coconut Orange Squares | Indian-Spiced Lentil Hemp Burgers | Banana Cream Pie | Summertime Chef Salad | as well as Brazier's signature energy bars and gels and many more . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> If you're looking for sustainable energy, high-quality sleep, physical strength, and mental sharpness to meet modern-day demands, <i>Thrive Foods</i> is the resource for you.</p><p>In the <i>Thrive Foods</i>, I introduce something called the Nutrient-to-Resource Ratio, which considers the amount of each natural resource that goes into food production in exchange for the amount of nutrients that food offers. Based on these findings, I then make suggestions as to what foods are most beneficial to personal health as well as environmental preservation. <b>The goal is simple: get as high a level of health-boosting micronutrients from food, while expending the smallest amount of each natural resource to do so.</b> (Essentially, it's a mathematical way of saying plant-based whole foods make a lot of sense). There are also 200 recipes, including a few from my favorite North American restaurants, as well as a few of my favorite chefs.Brendan Brazier is a former professional Ironman triathlete and the creator of VEGA, an award-winning whole food product line.

Eliot wrote in his introduction: "I hope that this volume will demonstrate that Pound's literary criticism is the most important contemporary criticism of its kind . . perhaps the kind we can least afford to do without . . . the refreshment, the revitalization and &#x2018;making new' of literature in our time."</p><p>New Directions has been the primary publisher of Ezra Pound in the U.S. since the founding of the press when James Laughlin published New Directions in Prose and Poetry 1936.

Whether assuming the form of the goddess Fortuna and her ever-turning wheel, or the abstract mathematic of &#x2018;randomness&#x2019;, her favor is universally sought, and her displeasure feared. To the devotee of Chance, the arts of divination may be regarded as her secret liturgy, providing glimpses of the unknown to those she esteems. Into the retort of the alchemist-poet, Pendell compounds portent, omen, oracle, and the art of prediction to distill The Language of the Birds, a reverie upon the nature of the Goddess of Fortune and the sacred function of Chance.

January 15, 1919, started off as a normal day in Boston&#x2019;s North End. Workers took a break for lunch, children played in the park, trains made trips between North and South Stations. Then all of a sudden a large tank of molasses exploded, sending shards of metal hundreds of feet away, collapsing buildings, and coating the harborfront community with a thick layer of sticky-sweet sludge. Deborah Kops takes the reader through this bizarre and relatively unknown disaster, including the cleanup and court proceedings that followed. What happened? Why did the tank explode? Many people died or were injured in the accident&#x2014;who was to blame? Kops focuses on several individuals involved in the events of that day, creating a more personal look at this terrible tragedy.</p><p>Deborah Kops is the author of more than a dozen nonfiction children&#x2019;s books, including ZACHARY TAYLOR: AMERICA'S 12TH PRESIDENT, SCHOLASTIC KID'S ALMANAC, and her Wild Birds of Prey series. She lives in Westford, Massachusetts.Of all the disasters that have occurred in the United States, the Great Molasses Flood in Boston was one of the most bizarre. Imagine a city neighborhood awash in molasses: that dark brown, sweet-and-sour liquid that sticks to everything like honey&#x2014;the same stuff that makes gingerbread men taste so good.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like a bad joke. But as the people of Boston discovered on January 15, 1919, a dark, rushing wave of molasses can be as destructive as a tornado.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The people who lived along the narrow, hilly streets of Boston&#x2019;s North End and worked on the nearby waterfront were not expecting a disaster. In fact, they thought life in Boston was getting better. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city&#x2019;s battle with a terrible disease had just ended. In late August 1918 a mysterious illness called the Spanish influenza had arrived on the shores of the United States. Boston was the first stop on its deadly race through the country.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In early October the mayor of Boston closed the city&#x2019;s schools, churches, and dance halls to try to keep the disease from spreading. A month later the worst of the epidemic was over in the city. Six thousand Boston residents had died of the flu.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By late fall 1918 things in Boston were looking up. Everyone had been thrilled when Babe Ruth helped the Red Sox win the World Series. Then in November the fighting in Europe stopped. The Great War was finally over, and the American troops&#x2014;hundreds of thousands of them&#x2014;were coming home.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; January 1919 was a hopeful time. Schools had reopened. So had the soda fountains, where kids went to buy Cokes. On New Year&#x2019;s Eve tens of thousands of cheering, singing Bostonians gathered to ring in the new year. They jammed the city&#x2019;s caf�s and hotels and overflowed into the streets. Everyone seemed thrilled that life in this old port city was returning to normal.</p><h2>The Baby-Led Weaning Family Cookbook: Your Baby Learns to Eat Solid Foods, You Enjoy the Convenience of One Meal for Everyone (The Authoritative Baby-Led Weaning Series)</h2><p><b>A National Parenting Product Award (NAPPA) Winner</b><br> &nbsp;<p><b>Yes, your baby <i>can </i>join in at family mealtimes&#x2014;right from the start!</b></p><p>Gill Rapley and Tracey Murkett are the creators of baby-led weaning (BLW), a commonsense way to introduce your baby to solid foods.

None of us is inherently righteous, so Paul's instructions regarding spiritual discipline in 1 Timothy 4:7-8 take on personal urgency: "Train yourself for godliness; for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come."</p> <p>That word "train" comes from the Greek word from which we derive gymnasium. So, I invite you into God's Gym--to some pain and great gain!</p> Discipline of Purity <p>Sensuality is the biggest obstacle to godliness among Christian men. The fall of King David should not only instruct us but scare the sensuality right out of us! Fill yourself with God's Word--memorize passages like 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8, Job 31:1, Proverbs 6:27, Ephesians 5:3-7, and 2 Timothy 2:22. Find someone who will help you keep your soul faithful to God.</p> <p>A pure mind is impossible if you mindlessly watch TV and movies or visit pornographic web sites (1 Thessalonians 4:3-7). Develop the divine awareness that sustained Joseph: "How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" (Genesis 39:9).</p> Discipline of Relationships <p>To be all God wants you to be, put some holy sweat into your relationships! If you're married, you need to live out Ephesians 5:25-31: "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her" (v. 25). For those who are fathers, God provides a workout in one pungent sentence: "Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord" (Ephesians 6:4).</p> <p>Relationships are not optional (Hebrews 10:25); they enable us to develop into what God wants us to be and most effectively learn and live God's truth.</p> Discipline of Mind <p>The potential of possessing the mind of Christ (1 Corinthians 2:16) introduces the scandal of today's church--Christians who do not think Christianly, leaving our minds undisciplined. The Apostle Paul understood this well: "...whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things" (Philippians 4:8). Each ingredient is a matter of personal choice.</p> <p>You can never have a Christian mind without reading the Scriptures regularly because you cannot be influenced by that which you do not know.</p> Discipline of Devotion <p>Reading God's Word is essential, but meditation internalizes the Word and responds, "I desire to do your will, O my God" (Psalm 40:8). Beyond instructions like Ephesians 6:18-20, there are two great reasons to pray. The more we expose our lives to the white-hot sun of Christ's righteous life, the more his image will be burned into our character. The second reason is that prayer bends our wills to God's will.</p> <p>Many men never have an effective devotional life because they never plan for it; they never expose their lives to his pure light.</p> Discipline of Integrity <p>We can hardly overstate the importance of integrity to a generation of believers so much like the world in ethical conduct. But integrity's benefits--character, a clear conscience, deep intimacy with God--argue its importance.</p> <p>We must let God's Word draw our lines of conduct. Our speech and actions must be intentionally true (Proverbs 12:22; Ephesians 4:15), backed by the courage to keep our word and stand up for our convictions (Psalm 15:4). An old saying sums it up: "Sow an act, reap a habit. Sow a habit, reap a character. Sow a character, reap a destiny."(1)</p> Discipline of Tongue <p>"If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless" (James 1:26). The true test of a man's spirituality is not his ability to speak, but rather his ability to bridle his tongue!</p> <p>Offered to God on the altar, the tongue has awesome power for good. There must be an ongoing prayerfulness and resolve to discipline ourselves: "Who keeps the tongue doth keep his soul."(2)</p> Discipline of Work <p>We meet God, the Creator, as a worker in Genesis 1:1-2:2. Since "God created man in his own image" (1:27), the way we work will reveal how much we allow the image of God to develop in us.</p> <p>There is no secular/sacred distinction; all honest work ought to be done to the glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31). We must recover the biblical truth that our vocation is a divine calling and thus be liberated to do it for the glory of God.</p> Discipline of Perseverance <p>Hebrews 12:1-3 presents a picture of perseverance in four commands.</p> <p>Divest! "Lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely" (v. 1a). That includes besetting sin, and anything else that hinders.</p> <p>Run! "...with endurance the race that is set before us" (v. 1b). Each of us can finish our race (see also 2 Timothy 4:7).</p> <p>Focus! "Looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith" (v. 2). There never was a millisecond that he did not trust the Father.</p> <p>Consider! Our life is to be spent considering how Jesus lived (v. 3).</p> Discipline of Church <p>You don't have to go to church to be a Christian; you don't have to go home to be married. But in both cases if you do not, you will have a very poor relationship!</p> <p>You will never attain your full spiritual manhood, nor will your family reach its spiritual maturity without commitment to the church. Find a good church, join it, and commit yourself to it wholeheartedly. Your participation should include financial support, but it should also include giving your time, talents, expertise, and creativity to the glory of God.</p> Discipline of Giving <p>How can we escape the power of materialism? By giving from a heart overflowing with God's grace, like the believers in Macedonia who "gave themselves first to the Lord" (2 Corinthians 8:5): this is where grace giving must begin.</p> <p>Giving disarms the power of money. Though giving should be regular, it should also be spontaneous and responsive to needs. And it should be joyous--"God loves a cheerful giver" (2 Corinthians 9:7). And Jesus said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive" (Acts 20:35).</p> <p>As we sweat out the disciplines of a godly man, remember, with Paul, what energizes us to live them out--"not I, but the grace of God that is with me" (1 Corinthians 15:10).</p> <ol><li>The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, Second Edition, (London: Oxford UP, 1959), p. 405.</li> <li>James S.

The book was designed to teach this young wife the moral attributes, duties, and conduct befitting a woman of her station in society, in the almost certain event of her widowhood and subsequent remarriage. The work also provides a rich assembly of practical materials for the wife's use and for her household, including treatises on gardening and shopping, tips on choosing servants, directions on the medical care of horses and the training of hawks, plus menus for elaborate feasts, and more than 380 recipes. </p><p>The Good Wife's Guide is the first complete modern English translation of this important medieval text also known as Le M�nagier de Paris (the Parisian household book), a work long recognized for its unique insights into the domestic life of the bourgeoisie during the later Middle Ages.

Rose, is accompanied by an informative critical introduction setting the work in its proper medieval context as a conduct manual. This edition presents the book in its entirety, as it must have existed for its earliest readers. The Guide is now a treasure for the classroom, appealing to anyone studying medieval literature or history or considering the complex lives of medieval women. It illuminates the milieu and composition process of medieval authors and will in turn fascinate cooking or horticulture enthusiasts.

I had a keen sense that I was stepping into a long- standing conversation between Abigail and John in its final phase. And I had an equivalently clear sense that the conversation preserved in the roughly twelve hundred letters between them constituted a treasure trove of unexpected intimacy and candor, more revealing than any other correspondence between a prominent American husband and wife in American history.<br><br>I moved on to different historical topics over the ensuing years, but I made a mental note to come back to the extraordinarily rich Adams archive, then read all their letters and tell the full story of their conversation within the context of America&#x2019;s creation as a people and a nation. The pages that follow represent my attempt to do just that.<br><br>The distinctive quality of their correspondence, apart from its sheer volume and the dramatic character of the history that was happening around them, is its unwavering emotional honesty. All of us who have fallen in love, tried to raise children, suffered extended bouts of doubt about the integrity of our ambitions, watched our once youthful bodies betray us, harbored illusions about our impregnable principles, and done all this with a partner traveling the same trail know what unconditional commitment means, and why, especially today, it is the exception rather than the rule. <br><br>Abigail and John traveled down that trail about two hundred years before us, remained lovers and friends throughout, and together had a hand in laying the foundation of what is now the oldest enduring republic in world history. And they left a written record of all the twitches, traumas, throbbings, and tribulations along the way. No one else has ever done that.<br><br>To be sure, there were other prominent couples in the revolutionary era&#x2014; George and Martha Washington as well as James and Dolley Madison come to mind. But no other couple left a documentary record of their mutual thoughts and feelings even remotely comparable to Abigail and John&#x2019;s. (Martha Washington burned almost all the letters to and from her husband.) And at the presidential level, it was not until Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt occupied the White House that a wife exercised an influence over policy decisions equivalent to Abigail&#x2019;s.<br><br>It is the interactive character of their private story and the larger public story of the American founding that strikes me as special. Recovering their experience as a couple quite literally forces a focus on the fusion of intimate psychological and emotional experience with the larger political narrative. Great events, such as the battle of Bunker Hill, the debate over the Declaration of Independence, and the presidential election of 1800, become palpable human experiences rather than grandiose abstractions. They lived through a truly formative phase of American history and left an unmatched record of what it was like to shape it, and have it happen to them.<br><br>As I see it, then, Abigail and John have much to teach us about both the reasons for that improbable success called the American<br>Revolution and the equally startling capacity for a man and woman&#x2014;husband and wife&#x2014; to sustain their love over a lifetime filled with daunting challenges. One of the reasons for writing this book was to figure out how they did it.<br><br>CHAPTER ONE<br><br>1759&#x2013;74<br><br>&#x201c;<i>And there is a tye more binding than<br>Humanity, and stronger than Friendship.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Knowing as we do that John and Abigail Adams were destined to become the most famous and consequential couple in the revolutionary era, indeed some would say the premier husband-and-wife team in all American history, it is somewhat disconcerting to realize that when they first met in the summer of 1759, neither one was particularly impressed by the other. The encounter occurred in the parlor of the pastor&#x2019;s house in Weymouth, Massachusetts, which happened to be the home of Abigail and her two sisters. Their father was the Reverend William Smith, whom John described in his diary as &#x201c;a crafty designing man,&#x201d; a veteran public speaker attuned to reading the eyes of his audience. &#x201c;I caught him, several times,&#x201d; wrote John, &#x201c;looking earnestly at my face.&#x201d; Like most successful pastors, he was accustomed to being the center of attention, which apparently annoyed John, who described Reverend Smith prancing across the room while gesturing ostentatiously, &#x201c;clapping his naked [?] sides and breasts with his hands before the girls."<br><br>Abigail, in fact, was still a girl, not quite fifteen years old to John&#x2019;s twenty-four. She was diminutive, barely five feet tall, with dark brown hair, brown eyes, and a slender shape more attractive in our own time than then, when women were preferred to be plump. John was quite plump, or as men would have it, stout, already showing the signs that would one day allow his enemies to describe him as &#x201c;His Rotundity.&#x201d; At five feet five or six, he was slightly shorter than the average American male of the day, and his already receding hairline promised pre-mature baldness. Neither one of them, at first glance, had the obvious glow of greatness.<br><br>John&#x2019;s verdict, recorded in his diary, was that he had wasted an evening. He was courting Hannah Quincy at the time&#x2014; some say that she was actually courting him&#x2014; and his first reaction was that neither Abigail nor her sisters could measure up to Hannah. They seemed to lack the conversational skills and just sat there, &#x201c;not fond, nor frank, not candid.&#x201d; Since Abigail eventually proved to be all these things, we can only conclude that this first meeting was an awkward occasion on which the abiding qualities of her mind and heart were obscured beneath the frozen etiquette of a pastor&#x2019;s parlor. And besides, she was only a teenager, nine years his junior, not even a legitimate candidate for his roving interest in a prospective wife.<br><br>To say that &#x201c;something happened&#x201d; to change their respective opinions of each other over the next three years is obviously inadequate, but the absence of documentary evidence makes it the best we can do. John had legal business in Weymouth that involved the status of the pastoral house occupied by the Smith family, which meant that he was literally forced to interact with Abigail. And he accompanied his then best friend, Richard Cranch, who was courting (and eventually married) Mary Smith, Abigail&#x2019;s older sister. This, too, prompted interactions. And his flirtatious relationship with Hannah Quincy ended in a mutually declared romantic truce, which made John, once again, eligible.<br><br>Time was also a factor. The difference between a fifteen- year-old girl and a twenty-four-year-old man seemed a chasm; the difference between eighteen and twenty- seven was much more negotiable. Though it seems too easy to say, chance and circumstance provided them with the opportunity to talk with each other, to move past the awkwardness of a stuffy Weymouth parlor, thereby initiating a conversation that lasted for almost sixty years.<br><br>But talk by itself was not sufficient to explain their mutual attraction. The letters that began to flow back and forth between them late in 1761 contain some explicit expressions of powerful physical and sexual urges, so that the picture that emerges depicts two young lovers conversing about Shakespeare&#x2019;s sonnets or Moli�re&#x2019;s plays in between long and multiple kisses, passionate embraces, and mutual caresses. Their grandson Charles Francis Adams, who published the first comprehensive edition of their correspondence nearly a century later, was either too embarrassed or too much a prisoner of Victorian mores to include any of their courtship correspondence. Here is a sample of what he chose to censor. John to Abigail, addressed to &#x201c;Miss Adorable&#x201d;: &#x201c;By the same token that the bearer hereof [JA] satt up with you last night, I hereby order you to give him, as many kisses, and as many Hours of your company after nine o&#x2019;clock as he pleases to demand, and charge them to my account.&#x201d;<br><br>Or John to Abigail, explaining that a sudden stormhad prevented a trip to see her atWeymouth: &#x201c;Yet perhaps blessed storm . . . for keeping one at my distance. For every experimental philosopher knows, that the steel and the magnet, or the glass and the feather will not fly together with more celerity . . . than somebody . . . when brought within striking distance&#x2014; and Itches, Aches, Agues, and Repentance might be the consequences of contact in present circumstances.&#x201d;<br><br>Then Abigail to John, proclaiming that their mutual attraction was visceral as well as intellectual: &#x201c;And there is a tye more binding than Humanity, and stronger than Friendship . . . unite these, and there is a threefold chord&#x2014; and by this chord I am not ashamed to say that I am bound, nor do I [believe] that you are wholly free from it.&#x201d;<br><br>The inevitable &#x201c;did they or didn&#x2019;t they&#x201d; question is impossible to answer conclusively, though their first child, named Abigail, was born eight and half months after their marriage, just barely within the bounds of propriety. But the fact that they were strongly tempted is beyond question, and a crucial indication that their affinity was not solely cerebral. For both of them, love entailed a level of intimacy that no conversation could completely capture and required a physical attraction. And they both felt it. If Abigail referred to it as &#x201c;the third chord,&#x201d; we might shift the metaphor and describe it as an emotional affinity that made unconditional trust between them a natural act.<br><br>One of the distinctive features of their extraordinary correspondence over a lifetime&#x2014;more than twelve hundred letters&#x2014;was also<br>present from the start, namely, the tendency to banter playfully about serious subjects, thereby creating a certain ambiguity as to whether the issue at stake was cause for concern or laughter. For example, in a note to Abigail&#x2019;s sister Mary, John jokingly claimed that Abigail was rumored to have a crush on the recently coronated British monarch, George III, and that &#x201c;altho my allegiance has been hitherto inviolate, I shall endeavor all in my Power, to foment Rebellion.&#x201d; (Little did he know that his joke would become a prescient prophecy.) Or there is Abigail&#x2019;s mock criticism of John that then concludes with a doubleedged compliment:<br>You was pleas&#x2019;d to say that the receipt of a letter from your Diana always gave you pleasure. Whether this was designed as a<br>compliment (a commodity I acknowledge that you seldom deal in) or as a real truth, you best know. Yet if I was to judge a certain persons Heart by what the like occasion passes through a cabinet of my own, I should be apt to suggest it as a truth. And why may<br>I not? When I have often been tempted to believe that they were both cast in the same mold, only with this difference, that yours was made with a harder mettle, and therefore is less liable to an impression. Whether they both have an eaquil quantity of steel, I have not yet been able to discover, but do not imagine that either of them are deficient.<br>Abigail was apparently more than half serious when, a few months before their wedding, she asked John to deliver on his promise &#x201c;and tell me all my faults, both of omission and commission, and all the evil you either know or think of me.&#x201d; John responded with a mock &#x201c;catalogue of your Faults, Imperfections, Deficits, or whatever you please to call them.&#x201d; She was, he observed, negligent at playing cards, could not sing a note, often hung her head like a bulrush, sat with her legs crossed, was pigeon- toed, and to cap it off, she read too much. Abigail responded that many of these defects were probably incurable, especially the reading, so he would have to learn to live with them. The leg-crossing charge struck her as awkward, since &#x201c;a gentleman has no business to concern himself with the leggs of a lady.&#x201d;<br><br>The letters exchanged during their courtship (1761&#x2013;64) provide the first and fullest window into the chemistry of their relationship, but it would probably be wrong to presume that the correspondence accurately reflected the way they talked to each other when together. Letter writing in the eighteenth century was a more deliberative and self-consciously artful exercise than those of us in the present, with our cell phones, e-mail, and text messaging, can fully fathom. The letters, of course, are all we have to recover the texture of their overlapping personalities. While they constitute a long string of emotional and intellectual pearls unmatched in the literature of the era, they were also self- conscious performances, quasi-theatrical presentations that were more stylized and orchestrated than real conversations. There are some things, in short, that we can never know for sure about their deepest thoughts and feelings, even though they are among the most fully revealed couples in American history.<br><br>Two essential ingredients in their lifetime literary dialogue were clear from the start: first, Abigail, despite the lack of any formal education, could match John with a pen, which was saying quite a lot, since he proved to be one of the master letter writers in an age not lacking in serious contenders; second, there was a presumed sense of psychological equality between them that Abigail expected and John found intoxicating. She was marrying a man who loved the fact that she was, as he put it, &#x201c;saucy,&#x201d; and he was marrying a woman who was simultaneously capable of unconditional love and personal independence. They recognized from the beginning that they were a rare match. There were so many topics they could talk about easily and just as many things they did not have to talk about at all.<br><br>The wedding occurred on October 25, 1764, in the same parlor of her father&#x2019;s house in Weymouth where they had initially found each other so uninteresting. In her last letter to John before the wedding, Abigail asked him to take all her belongings, which she was forwarding in a cart to their new home in Braintree. &#x201c;And then Sir, if you please,&#x201d; she concluded, &#x201c;you may take me.&#x201d;8<br>DOWRIES<br><br>What did each of them bring to the marriage? Well, most basically, John brought sixty acres of land and a small house that he had inherited from his father, who died in 1761. Abigail brought a cartload of furniture and a household servant, who was partially paid for by her father. By the standards of New England at that time, these assets, though hardly massive, were not meager. They were starting off with more material resources than most newlyweds.<br><br>What about their respective bloodlines? On this score Abigail brought more status than John. Her mother was a Quincy, a name that rested atop the Braintree elite; the family eventually had the town named after them. Their mansion at Mount Wollaston was the closest thing to a baronial estate outside of Boston. Her father was a Harvard-educated minister, while John&#x2019;s was a farmer and shoemaker without a college education. <br><br>But this discrepancy was a bit deceptive, because Deacon Adams, as he was called, was a respected local leader who, at one time or another, had held every office in the Braintree town government. Moreover, as John made a point of emphasizing in his autobiography, the Adams family could trace its lineage back to 1638, making it one of the most long-standing families in Massachusetts, a venerable if not particularly prominent line.<br><br>That said, when John graduated from Harvard in 1755, he was ranked fourteenth out of twenty- five students, a ranking based solely on family status rather than academic achievement. (Academically, by the way, he was one of the top three students in his class, and the status-based system of ranking became a casualty of the Am...</p><h2>French Theory: How Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, &amp; Co. Transformed the Intellectual Life of the United States</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A great story, full of twists and turns. . . . Careers made and ruined, departments torn apart, writing programs turned into sensitivity seminars, political witch hunts, public opprobrium, ignorant media attacks, the whole ball of wax. Read it and laugh or read it and weep. I can hardly wait for the movie.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stanley Fish, <i>Think Again, New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;In such a difficult genre, full of traps and obstacles, French Theory is a success and a remarkable book in every respect: it is fair, balanced, and informed. I am sure this book will become the reference on both sides of the Atlantic.&#x201d; &#x2014;Jacques Derrida</p><p>&#x201c;The Atlantic Ocean has two sides, and so does French Theory. Reinvented in America and betrayed in its own country, it has become the most radical intellectual movement in the West with global reach, rewriting Marx in light of late capitalism. Breathtakingly moving back and forth between the two cultures, Francois Cusset takes us through a dazzling intellectual adventure that illuminates the past thirty years, and many more decades to come.&#x201d; &#x2014;Sylvere Lotringer<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>During the last three decades of the twentieth century, a disparate group of radical French thinkers achieved an improbable level of influence and fame in the United States. Compared by at least one journalist to the British rock &#x2018;n&#x2019; roll invasion, the arrival of works by Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jean-Fran�ois Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Gilles Deleuze, and F�lix Guattari on American shores in the late 1970s and 1980s caused a sensation. </p><p>Outside the academy, &#x201c;French theory&#x201d; had a profound impact on the era&#x2019;s emerging identity politics while also becoming, in the 1980s, the target of right-wing propagandists. At the same time in academic departments across the country, their poststructuralist form of radical suspicion transformed disciplines from literature to anthropology to architecture. By the 1990s, French theory was woven deeply into America&#x2019;s cultural and intellectual fabric.</p><p>French Theory is the first comprehensive account of the American fortunes of these unlikely philosophical celebrities. Fran�ois Cusset looks at why America proved to be such fertile ground for French theory, how such demanding writings could become so widely influential, and the peculiarly American readings of these works. Reveling in the gossipy history, Cusset also provides a lively exploration of the many provocative critical practices inspired by French theory. Ultimately, he dares to shine a bright light on the exultation of these thinkers to assess the relevance of critical theory to social and political activism today-showing, finally, how French theory has become inextricably bound with American life.</p><p>Fran�ois Cusset, a writer and intellectual historian, teaches contemporary French thought in Paris at the Institut d&#x2019;Etudes Politiques and at Columbia University&#x2019;s Reid Hall. His books include Queer Critics and La D�cennie.</p><p>Jeff Fort is assistant professor of French at the University of California, Davis.

Written with humor, sympathy, and tenderness, this intricately woven novel proves him to be the master of an altogether different art form.<br><br>LOVE, DISHONOR, MARRY, DIE, CHERISH, PERISH leaps cities and decades as Rakoff sings the song of an America whose freedoms can be intoxicating, or brutal.&nbsp; <br><br>The characters' lives are linked to each other by acts of generosity or cruelty. A daughter of Irish slaughterhouse workers in early-twentieth-century Chicago faces a desperate choice; a hobo offers an unexpected refuge on the rails during the Great Depression; a vivacious aunt provides her clever nephew a path out of the crushed dream of postwar Southern California; an office girl endures the casually vicious sexism of 1950s Manhattan; the young man from Southern California revels in the electrifying sexual and artistic openness of 1960s San Francisco, then later tends to dying friends and lovers as the AIDS pandemic devastates the community he cherishes; a love triangle reveals the empty materialism of the Reagan years; a marriage crumbles under the distinction between self-actualization and humanity; as the new century opens, a man who has lost his way finds a measure of peace in a photograph he discovers in an old box&#x2014;an image of pure and simple joy that unites the themes of this brilliantly conceived work.<br><br>Rakoff's insistence on beauty and the necessity of kindness in a selfish world raises the novel far above mere satire.&nbsp; A critic once called Rakoff "magnificent," a word that perfectly describes this wonderful novel in verse.</p><p><b>David Rakoff</b> was the<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author of the books <i>Fraud</i>, <i>Don't Get Too Comfortable</i>, and <i>Half Empty</i>.

Augustus. Tiberius. Gaius. Caligula (Loeb Classical Library, No. 31) (Volume I)</h2><p><p>Suetonius (C. Suetonius Tranquillus, born ca. 70 CE), son of a military tribune, was at first an advocate and a teacher of rhetoric, but later became the emperor Hadrian's private secretary, 119&#x2013;121. He dedicated to C. Septicius Clarus, prefect of the praetorian guard, his <i>Lives of the Caesars.</i> After the dismissal of both men for some breach of court etiquette, Suetonius apparently retired and probably continued his writing. His other works, many known by title, are now lost except for part of the <i>Lives of Illustrious Men</i> (of letters).</p><p>Friend of Pliny the Younger, Suetonius was a studious and careful collector of facts, so that the extant lives of the emperors (including Julius Caesar the dictator) to Domitian are invaluable. His plan in <i>Lives of the Caesars</i> is: the emperor's family and early years; public and private life; death. We find many anecdotes, much gossip of the imperial court, and various details of character and personal appearance. Suetonius's account of Nero's death is justly famous.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Suetonius is in two volumes.

Arguing against the predetermined outcomes of dialectical thought with his renowned, wry, ambivalent passion, with this volume Jean Baudrillard mounted an attack against the &#x201c;false problems&#x201d; posed by Western philosophy. If his Marxist days were firmly behind him, Baudrillard here indicated that metaphysics had also gone the way of sociology and politics: the contemporary world demanded nothing less than Pataphysics, Alfred Jarry's absurdist philosphy that described the laws of the universe supplementary to this one. In effect, with<i> Fatal Strategies</i>, Baudrillard became Baudrillard. In his extrapolationist manner, Baudrillard sought to replace Western philosophy's circular arguments with a ritualistic Theater of Cruelty. Using this line of thought developed in <i>Fatal Strategies</i>, Baudrillard went on, throughout the 1980s, to find new and shatteringly accurate ways of discussing American corporatocracy, arms build-up, and hostage taking. <i>Fatal Strategies</i> asserts a profound critique of American politics, and it is an important step towards his examination of evil.Jean Baudrillard (1929-2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision. An outsider in the French intellectual establishment, he was internationally renowned as a twenty-first century visionary, reporter, and provocateur. His Simulations (1983) instantly became a cult classic and made him a controversial voice in the world of politics and art.</p></p><p>Jean Baudrillard (1929&#x2013;2007) was a philosopher, sociologist, cultural critic, and theorist of postmodernity who challenged all existing theories of contemporary society with humor and precision.

Instead of studying during his free time, the teen explores the city, and one day ends up in an area that seems deserted. Drawn in by music coming from an old dilapidated house, Oscar is given a scare by the owner, an eccentric and haunted German artist. Having accidently taken a watch from the house, the boy returns to bring the valuable item back and meets the enigmatic Marina. Realizing that they both like mysteries, Marina invites Oscar on an escapade to a graveyard to observe a woman who leaves a red rose on an unmarked grave. The two follow this woman, lose her, but eventually wander into an abandoned greenhouse filled with sinister marionettes and grotesque photos. Soon, the narrator becomes embroiled in the lives and histories of a presumed dead actress, recluse tycoon, and mad scientist obsessed with escaping death.

The sun doesn't set until nine thirty or ten during summer at this latitude, so it feels early. Treasuring the quiet, moving like a French Country Ninja, I put on the water, light the gas stove, quietly clean off the wineglasses, dessert plates, and empty bottles from last night. I ease open the window facing the dining table. A giant flowering bush pushes inside. It has to be pushed back outside every evening, like a last inebriated guest. I inhale herb-scented air, listen to the buzz of the bees. The square is empty, the village silent, the sky pink from sun diffused through a cottony marine haze.</p> <p>With a faint crunch of gravel underfoot, Suzanne strolls into view, hands clasped behind her back, trailed by a kitten. She's in her usual blue apron over her usual blue-black shirtdress, the same outfit she's worn every day for the last ten years, and probably every adult day of her life. The kitten dances with her heels and boxes the hem of her dress.</p> <p>Suzanne moseys over to the well in the wall. Terraced sides of uneven stones form a veritable Hanging Garden of Babylon with the clippings she has inserted into the moist crevices. Her fingers fuss, tamping and fixing. She plucks a few live shoots to tuck into her apron pockets and transplant elsewhere. Then, hands clasped behind her back, she continues her promenade up the lane, past our door, eyes sweeping the flowers and shrubs along our thin verge of garden, most of which she's planted and tended when we're away, back in the States. If she were to raise her eyes, she'd see me. But like most older Bellilois, she tries not to look into windows or open doorways. Or at least if she does, to not get caught.</p> <p>A hiss from water spitting from the pot breaks the spell, sends me back to the stove. She probably knows I'm watching, anyway.</p> <p>Tap-tap-tap. Work has started somewhere. Peering out through the lace curtains on our door's window, hand-knitted by Suzanne, I spot a close-cropped head rising above the tile roofline of the tall A-framed cowshed across the square. Rolling a dozen nails between his lips, Loup slides slates into place and tap-tap-taps. Another slate down, nine thousand to go.</p> <p>A well-muscled guy with a large tattoo of his German shepherd on his bicep, Loup is single-handedly rehabbing the long, narrow building. He's restored the exterior walls to simple drystone glory, a seventeenth-century skill he had to teach himself. He's ripped out the cow stalls and laid a floor of antique salvage oak, then an upper story where once swallows nested and shat. I've seen the future of the cowshed and it's gorgeous: a building that sat ignored and decaying for forty years will soon be mistaken for an elegant village relic. Parisian women will set their snares for Loup, only to find themselves flustered and outsmarted by his first love, work. Meanwhile, one more blackened tooth in Kerbordardou�'s crooked smile will be restored.</p> <p>Clad in chic powder blue running togs, the blond wife of the Unforgiving Couple steps out into the square and does a quick set of bends and stretches. Fifteen years ago, the couple bought the empty lot across from us, a field of weeds spanned by rusted arches of iron that formerly supported the roof of a barn. Mindy and I took the loss of our view-a blue line of sea-stoically. One day the arches would be attractive hazards for our son and the village children, we thought.</p> <p>But before we could meet the couple, they submitted plans for a three-story McMansion to the Mairie de Sauzon, or mayor's office. Once enough people had taken a look and gagged, Gwened the Archer led a charm offensive. The couple blew her off. Gwened took our protest to the Mairie de Sauzon, who dismissed her as a mere second-home owner, even though her grandfather was from Belle �le and she had been coming here her whole life.</p> <p>When she informed him about the regulations on the books and how they forbade a third story, he patronized her. That did it. Gwened went door to door with a petition, the first, some said, in island history. About half of the second-home owners signed it, but not us-Gwened felt having un �tranger Am�ricain would backfire. The Bellilois elected not to sign: such is the strength of feeling here about imposing one's opinions on others. When Gwened returned to the Mairie, he shrugged. Madame, we have never been presented with a petition and this is not the time to start.</p> <p>That left the fate of that lot to our village's widowed matriarch, owner of the surrounding fields. No way the stern and reserved Madame Morgane would sign anything so forward as a petition, but she agreed to go to the post office, which was next door to the Mairie de Sauzon, who happened to be in, with his door wide open to the street. Naturally he greeted her. A conversation took place. The subject almost didn't come up. Then he scoffed at all this foolishness. She replied that the new house would be "too tall."</p> <p>Too tall? The Mairie frowned. The first plan was rejected. A second came in with two stories-but enormous glass walls. This was actually easier for the Mairie to reject. There are laws against that sort of thing. Belle �le enjoys national heritage status, which specifically covers home construction and renovation.</p> <p>The couple responded by building a house without any windows facing the square, which was fine with us once some ivy grew up the blank white wall. In fifteen years, I can't remember them once waving hello. It's really too bad.</p> <p>Oh, well. They don't come from here. They don't even come from somebody, as the political machine hacks say in Chicago.</p> <p>At least we come from "somebody"-and gratefully. Gwened. She lured us here-invited us to Belle �le when we were reeling around Europe fifteen years ago, our dream of living and writing in Paris having come undone. Mindy had been her student long before, in the campus abroad program where Gwened taught. Gwened had offered us her house and ended up changing our life.</p> <p>The wife runs off, hippity-hop, classic le jogging style. Spooning out black mounds of cheap supermarket coffee, as good and aromatic as any of the expensive beans I noisily grind in our kitchen back in New York, I pour the boiling water into a cone filter wobbling atop a brown pot hand-thrown by our Scandinavian potter neighbor. Suddenly a voice echoes in my head: My very own randy Dane up the lane...</p> <p>It's my sister's joke, from her visit a year ago, and a bit unfair-though the potter certainly did trail Anne around his atelier in the fields. What a view to a seduction he had: fat yellow heads of buckwheat bending to the breeze, then a dark dense green windbreak of cypresses, and after that, the wide, glittering blue-steel sea. The Atlantic. Pure horizon.</p> <p>His tanned fingers kneading Anne's arm, finding more muscle than expected, he cried out in English: "But you are strong!" Excited, as if imagining her churning butter on his Viking homestead, walking behind the plow, a baby crooked in each arm.</p> <p>"Merci," she said, mustering all her French. With a flutter of her eyelashes she pulled away. "Unfortunately, we really must be going."</p> <p>"Just think," Anne sighed that day, after we rode away on our rickety bikes, the potter waving forlornly to our backs. "If I ran away with him, we could live in adjoining villages and pay each other visits at teatime."</p> <p>"That would be nice," said Mindy.</p> <p>"We could have Earl Grey in cups made by my very own randy Dane up the lane."</p> <p>"Anne!" Mindy shrieked. Et voil�! The quip attached itself to the pot like a superfluous handle.</p> <p>Mindy always says Anne is the sister she never had. They laugh together, joke together, surf Huntington Beach's Chair 16 together. But we don't see enough of her. Since at different hours of the day Anne is a mother, a wife, a stepmother, a daughter, a schoolteacher, a golf teacher, and a writer, I'm sure nobody sees enough of her. Living on opposite coasts doesn't help, which is our fault for moving to New York City.</p> <p>As I sat there, watching the coffee drip into the brown potter's cups, I missed my sister and considered how hard that trip must have been for her. Getting Anne over here is a project of ours. She's chafed at living in our hometown all her life. Once or twice she almost left, but for some reason at the city limits, life always pulled a U-turn.</p> <p>The first time she was about to make her escape from Long Beach, on a yearlong surf safari down to Mexico and South America with her boyfriend, the car broke down on the freeway on-ramp. Our parents came down hard on the guy, and they broke up. Before I even heard about any of this, she was engaged to the son of our father's business partner, who proposed, I think, on the golf course. Anne had two young kids before the marriage went bad. She might have gone south to make a new start, but in the same week she was diagnosed with stage IV throat cancer. Divorced and healed up after miracle surgery and radiation, she found a man. He wouldn't commit.</p> <p>Then the current one came along, a carpenter who surfed and read The New Yorker. Ideal, right? She married him. But already there were strains. Anne's teenaged daughter was acting out big-time. And, underlying everything, a deeper tension rattled my sister's confidence. She'd confided to me that she'd glimpsed the pattern of her life and vowed that, no matter what, she'd bust out one day, if only to Seal Beach, just across the county line.</p> <p>As I was helping Anne to engineer her escape to Belle �le, I fed her air routes and plans for her whole family to come. Circumstances combined to whittle it down to just her and her son. When she hesitated, I supplied rationales for a vacation from the tempestuous daughter, the teaching job, the old dog, cat, and plants-oh, yes, and from her husband's three kids on alternate weekends. She definitely needed a break, I argued. And successfully.</p> <p>But what I didn't realize was how selfish that was. All these people loved her and had legitimate claims on her. I was beginning to see I really wanted her to validate Belle �le for me. I wanted to see Belle �le through her eyes. And to watch her fall in love with it. After so much family criticism over our coming here, of all places, rather than closer to home in California, I wanted to see her pick up on the way the island was like all those idyllic Pacific coves and beaches we knew when we were children, before the bulldozers and housing tracts. Like those places, but better. I wanted to give Anne this, and then surely she'd do as we'd done-make every effort to return every year.</p> <p>Belle �le was already Mindy's and my alternative base from home, established over the protests of our families. Now, like every breakaway republic, we were recruiting, and because Anne was the shining light, the radiant one, among the Wallaces, I'd introduced a conflict of loyalties, forcing her to choose between us and the rest of the family. She saw it. I didn't, not yet.</p> <p>Once I got my wish and she was here, of course Anne would be Anne. On her third day here last summer, she watched me prepare for a picnic with the kids at the Hidden Grotto of Swimming Lizards. "I want to play that thirteen-hole golf course," she said. "Sarah Bernhardt's golf course. The first course started by a woman. I can sell a story about that to Golf for Women and pay most of my expenses here." She tossed her head back and laughed, as if feeling the fingers of the wind coursing through her hair. "You can write one, too, Donny. And you, Mindy. We can make so much money and expense dinners at the H�tel du Fart."</p> <p>"Du Phare," corrected Mindy, laughing at Anne's wicked mispronunciation of our island's most picturesque restaurant. "Pronounced far, meaning lighthouse."</p> <p>"Wait! Then what's that dessert we had at H�tel du Pharrrrt?"</p> <p>"Far Breton."</p> <p>"Lighthouse cake?"</p> <p>"Noooo..."</p> <p>Anne was having such a good time mangling the language that it actually made me jealous. Normally that was my gig. At dinner at the H�tel du Phare she'd feigned confusion at every menu choice, fruites des mer becoming "fruit of a female horse" instead of a seafood plate and so forth, ending with the rubbery egg and prune concoction called "Far Breton."</p> <p>"Wait-how can phare be a lighthouse and far a cake?"</p> <p>"One word is French, the other Breton," I explained.</p> <p>"Well, I think that for you, Far Breton means &#x2018;sweet distance,'" she replied curtly.</p> <p>Snark from Anne was a surprise. "Meaning?"</p> <p>"You didn't just go for the Far Breton," she said mock accusatively. "You went for the Far, Far Breton."</p> <p>"Look, I like Long Beach." Our hometown.</p> <p>"Funny way to show it, going ten thousand miles away."</p> <p>"Only five. Look at Mindy. Hawaii's even farther."</p> <p>"Far, far, far." Anne shook her head. Message delivered: we were too far away. Though I still didn't know from whom, I could guess: Mom.</p> <p>But, being Anne, she immediately deflected the point of the barb toward herself. "And I still can't get out of Long Beach."</p> <p>This actually caused a pang of remorse. I felt she'd read my mind, that she thought that I thought she'd missed out on life. Stuck in the old hometown, repeating herself. I couldn't reply.</p> <p> </p> <p>My morning reverie comes to an end when our eleven-year-old, Rory, and David, Anne's son, tumble downstairs and briefly struggle over which of the deep wicker chairs to sit in. There's no difference, except for a matter of placement. The far end of the table is the prize. Mumbling good morning, they attack their waiting cups of hot cocoa and Krispy Rolls "Suedoise"-a kind of Swedish hardtack.</p> <p>But all is repetition here, too, I should've protested to Anne. If only she had come this year, too-but, instead, she sent her giant teenager to eat us out of house and home. Fortunately, we love Devo, a six-foot-four high schooler. Even better, he came bearing an envelope of cash with "Feed Me" written on it.</p> <p>Mindy has been upstairs for a while, writing in her journal. Now she comes for her coffee and Krispy Rolls. We have only a few scrapes of blackberry jam left in the jar but plenty of butter. Only in France do we put butter on bread. There's no point in trying it in the States; I've tried, and it doesn't taste anything like the incomparable beauty of French beurre.</p> <p>Crunching and sipping, the boys lean over the chessboard and begin setting up the pieces.</p> <p>"No!" shouts Mindy. "No chess until you make a surf check." Mindy can't plan her day unless she knows whether there are waves.</p> <p>"Hmm," says Devo. "No surf check until checkmate." He moves his pawn.</p> <p>"No lunch unless you make surf check. Chop-chop! Now!" Mindy claps her hands loudly. Yesterday the boys started playing a game and didn't leave the house until early afternoon. This plays hell with our schedule, such as it is. The threat of no lunch usually works. When it doesn't, and we abandon the boys to their own devices, there is a definite danger that the house won't be there when we return, due to the combination of Devo's appetite and the stove, knobless after several explosions.</p> <p>"Your move."</p> <p>"I'll make you an omelet if you check surf now," Mindy pleads.</p> <p>"Hmm. What kind of omelet?"</p> <p>"Chorizo and tomatoes and Gruyere."</p> <p>"Okay." Devo looks at Rory. Then, with a crash, both shove their chairs back and race for the door. There's a struggle at the handle that Rory loses, being a foot shorter and seventy pounds lighter than his older cousin. But he's faster and arrives first at the bikes leaning against Gwened's barn. One bike's chain slips; the other doesn't. Another struggle begins.</p></p><h2>The Power of the Blood of Christ</h2><p>In this classic exploration of the Scriptures, Andrew Murray leads the reader to a complete understanding of the significance and reality of the power of the shed blood of Christ.<br> Astounding results can take place in your life once you have learned about the power of the blood of Jesus and come to understand how to use it in coping with life&#x2019;s difficult situations. This mighty weapon of spiritual warfare holds the secret to a victorious life.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Andrew Murray</b> (1828&#x2013;1917) was an amazingly prolific Christian writer. He lived and ministered as both a pastor and author in the towns and villages of South Africa. Some of Murray&#x2019;s earliest works were written to provide nurture and guidance to Christians, whether young or old in the faith; they were actually an extension of his pastoral work. Once books such as <i>Abide in Christ, Divine Healing, </i>and<i> With Christ in the School of Prayer</i> were written, Murray became widely known, and new books from his pen were awaited with great eagerness throughout the world.<br> He wrote to give daily practical help to many of the people in his congregation who lived out in the farming communities and could come into town for church services only on rare occasions. As he wrote these books of instruction, Murray adopted the practice of placing many of his more devotional books into thirty-one separate readings to correspond with the days of the month.<br> At the age of seventy-eight, Murray resigned from the pastorate and devoted most of his time to his manuscripts. He continued to write profusely, moving from one book to the next with an intensity of purpose and a zeal that few men of God have ever equaled. He often said of himself, rather humorously, that he was like a hen about to hatch an egg; he was restless and unhappy until he got the burden of the message off his mind.<br> During these later years, after hearing of pocket-sized paperbacks, Andrew Murray immediately began to write books to be published in that fashion. He thought it was a splendid way to have the teachings of the Christian life at your fingertips, where they could be carried around and read at any time of the day.<br> One source has said of Andrew Murray that his prolific style possesses the strength and eloquence that are born of deep earnestness and a sense of the solemnity of the issues of the Christian life. Nearly every page reveals an intensity of purpose and appeal that stirs men to the depths of their souls. Murray moves the emotions, searches the conscience, and reveals the sins and shortcomings of many of us with a love and hope born out of an intimate knowledge of the mercy and faithfulness of God.<br> For Andrew Murray, prayer was considered our personal home base from which we live our Christian lives and extend ourselves to others. During his later years, the vital necessity of unceasing prayer in the spiritual life came to the forefront of his teachings. It was then that he revealed the secret treasures of his heart concerning a life of persistent and believing prayer.<br> Countless people the world over have hailed Andrew Murray as their spiritual father and given credit for much of their Christian growth to the influence of his priceless devotional books.<br> &nbsp;Text: English, Dutch (translation)</p><h2>Glitz-2-Go</h2><p>Glitz-2-Go collects nearly 40 years of comics stories by Diane Noomin.

Spider Jerusalem, journalist and hero of sorts in Warren Ellis' <i>Transmetropolitan</i>, wades through a sewer of poverty and high-tech despair daily in his efforts to understand and report on America. In <i>The New Scum</i>, Ellis contrasts the powerful, in the form of presidential candidates, with the powerless, who are begging and hustling on the streets. The satire is savage and rarely subtle, but the author takes care to show some human warmth lest the comic descend into the nihilism it warns against. The plot, largely secondary to the characters and background events, focuses loosely on Jerusalem's assignment to interview the two candidates, each psychotic and unfit for any office. His bodyguard and personal assistant, meanwhile, discover the terrors of pleasure in a post-nanotech world with unlimited credit. The election-eve climax fully captures the anxiety and depression that come from having no real choice in matters of great importance.

In The Hidden Lives of Congregations, Christian educator and consultant Israel Galindo takes leaders below the surface of congregational life to provide a comprehensive, holistic look at the corporate nature of church relationships and the invisible dynamics at play. Informed by family systems theory and grounded in a wide-ranging ecclesiological understanding, Galindo unpacks clearly the factors of congregational lifespan, size, spirituality, and identity and shows how these work together to form the congregation&#x2019;s hidden life. He provides useful tools for diagnosing and understanding how one&#x2019;s congregation fits into the various categories he names and suggests what leadership skills are necessary to get beyond the impasse of surface issues and help the congregation achieve its mission. <br>The Hidden Lives of Congregations provides one of the most far-reaching looks into the invisible nature of faith communities written in recent years. For seminaries and divinity schools, it provides a standard text for getting a solid start in congregational practices; for experienced pastors, it provides support for renewing ministry; for lay leaders and committees, it offers insight to deepening mutual ministry.

Mystery is not often discussed&#x2015;apart from the genre&#x2015;because, as Maud Casey says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy to talk about something that is a whispered invitation, a siren song, a flickering light in the distance.&#x201d; Casey, the author of several critically acclaimed novels, reaches beyond the usual tool kit of fictional elements to ask the question: Where does mystery reside in a work of fiction? She takes us into the Land of Un&#x2015;a space of uncertainty and unknowing&#x2015;to find out and looks at the variety of ways mystery is created through character, image, structure, and haunted texts, including the novels of Shirley Jackson, Paul Yoon, J. M. Coetzee, and more. Casey&#x2019;s wide-ranging discussion encompasses spirit photography, the radical nature of empathy, and contradictory characters, as she searches for questions rather than answers. <i>The Art of Mystery </i>is a striking and vibrant addition to the much-loved <i>Art of</i> series.</p></p><p><b>Maud Casey</b> is the author of three novels, most recently <i>The Man Who Walked Away</i>, and a story collection, <i>Drastic. </i>She is the grateful recipient of the Italo Calvino Prize, the St. Francis College Literary Prize, and a Guggenheim Fellowship.

In <i>Affect, Imagery, Consciousness</i>, a four-volume work published over the last thirty years of his life, Tomkins developed an ambitious theory of affect steeped in cybernetics and systems theory as well as in psychoanalysis, ethology, and neuroscience. The implications of his conceptually daring and phenomenologically suggestive theory are only now&#x2014;in the context of postmodernism&#x2014;beginning to be understood. With <i>Shame and Its Sisters</i>, editors Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and Adam Frank make available for the first time an engaging and accessible selection of Tomkins&#x2019;s work. <br>Featuring intensive examination of several key affects, particularly shame and anger, this volume contains many of Tomkins&#x2019;s most haunting, diagnostically incisive, and theoretically challenging discussions.

At the same time, it's not a war novel. Instead, it's a skillfully constructed literary IED that brings together the sharpest aspects from multiple genres. It's a Tarantino-esque <i>Heart of Darkness</i> set in war-torn Iraq, filled with absurdism and dark humor, a mash-up of satirical Joseph Heller-style comedy and sci-fi fantasy with a gratuitous mixture of good old-fashioned ultra-violence."

SMITH</b> is an Episcopal priest and the author of <i>The Word Is Very Near You</i>.In this brief volume, Martin Smith . . . presents a practical guide to those who are preparing for their initial sacramental confession. The book does two things. It sketches a road map of the process of confession and it provides some excellent exercises for self-examination that may be used in the weeks prior to one's confession. . . .&#x201c;The strength of this book is that it remains true to its aim and focus. It provides a clear guide to confession that would be a valuable resource in preparing parishioners for confession. Smith&#x201d;s work is undergirded with sound theology, a clear understanding of what one experiences in sacramental confession, and an awareness of the complexity and seduction of human rationalization and the cleansing, convicting activity of the Holy Spirit. As a Lenten study, this volume could be useful in preparing priest and people for Pre-Easter sacramental confession. (Peter B. Stube <i>Virginia Seminary Journal</i>)<br><br>Martin Smith . . . has written a theologically sensitive and personally insightful book addressed primarily to those who wish to make use of this new rite (in either of its two forms) and who desire to &#x2018;receive the forgiveness of God&#x2015;not just as a general truth or a vague promise, but personally, immediately, in actual experience' (p.1). His aim, then, is to assist the penitent in preparing for his or her first sacramental confession. It is surely also a valuable guide for those who regularly or on occasion hear confessions as well as for those who regularly or on occasion make their confessions. For each of these, the book is a rich resource, one that leads the reader into a deeper understanding of the theology of reconciliation and of the nature of God's forgiving love. . . .&#x201c;Two appendices . . . are useful additions to Smith's timely and discerning book.

Providing ample material for study in both undergraduate and graduate courses, <em>Analyzing</em> <em>Classical Form</em> presents the most up-to-date version of the author's "theory of formal functions." Students will learn how to make complete harmonic and formal analyses of music drawn from the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. Part 1 introduces the principal theme-types of classical instrumental music; part 2 provides a methodology for analyzing sonata form, the most important formal type in this style period; and part 3 considers other full-movement forms found in this repertory (such as minuet, rondo, and concerto). The chapters are organized in a way that presents the most basic materials upfront and then leads the student through more details and finer points of theory. Every topic is illustrated with annotated musical examples; as well, the book contains many unannotated examples that can be used for in-class discussion and for out-of-class analytical exercises. A complete glossary of terms and questions for reviewing the theory will help students assimilate the many theoretical concepts employed in the book.

It is more than just a topic of intellectual interest: it has become part of a moral and political heritage. But after two centuries, this central event in French history has usually been thought of in much the same terms as it was by its contemporaries. There have been many accounts of the French Revolution, and though their opinions differ, they have often been commemorative or anniversary interpretations of the original event. The dividing line of revolutionary historiography, in intellectual terms, is therefore not between the right and the left, but between commemorative and conceptual history, as exemplified respectively in the works of Michelet and Tocquevifle. In this book, Fran�ois Furet analyses how an event like the French Revolution can be conceptualised, and identifies the radically new changes the Revolution produced as well as the continuity it provided, albeit under the appearance of change. This question has become a riddle for the European left, answered neither by Marx nor by the theorists of our own century. In his analysis of the tragic relevance of the Revolution, Furet both refers to contemporary experience and discusses various elements in the work of Alexis de Tocclueville and that of Augustin Cochin, which has never been systematically applied by historians of the Revolution. Furet&#39;s book is based on the complementary ideas of these two writers in an attempt to cut through the apparent and misleading clarity of various contradictory views of the Revolution, and to help decipher some of the enigmatic problems of revolutionary ideology. It will be of value to historians of modern Europe and their students; to political, social and economic historians; to sociologists; and to students of political thought.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)&#39; ... a milestone in the historiography of the French Revolution.&#39; William Doyle, History Today</p><h2>Nutrition for Foodservice and Culinary Professionals</h2><p><p><b><i>Nutrition for Foodservice and Culinary Professionals, 9th Edition</i></b> balances the perspectives of a nutritionist and a chef, offering the most up-to-date coverage of national dietary guidelines and engaging the learner in practical, hands-on application of each concept in the course. <i>Nutrition 9th Edition</i> is for nutrition (or &#x201c;healthy cooking&#x201d;) courses in a culinary arts curriculum and intends to be a practical, how-to program with up-to-date information on national nutrition guidelines and standards for food preparation and labeling.</p></p><p><p><b>KAREN EICH DRUMMOND</b> is the author and co-author of numerous books, including&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Restaurant Training Manual&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Dictionary of Nutrition and Dietetics,&nbsp;</i>all published by Wiley.

In <i>The New American Farmer</i>, Laura-Anne Minkoff-Zern explores the experiences of Latino/a immigrant farmers as they transition from farmworkers to farm owners, offering a new perspective on racial inequity and sustainable farming. She finds that many of these new farmers rely on farming practices from their home countries&#x2015;including growing multiple crops simultaneously, using integrated pest management, maintaining small-scale production, and employing family labor&#x2015;most of which are considered alternative farming techniques in the United States.</p><p>Drawing on extensive interviews with farmers and organizers, Minkoff-Zern describes the social, economic, and political barriers immigrant farmers must overcome, from navigating USDA bureaucracy to racialized exclusion from opportunities. She discusses, among other topics, the history of discrimination against farm laborers in the United States; the invisibility of Latino/a farmers to government and universities; new farmers' sense of agrarian and racial identity; and the future of the agrarian class system.</p><p>Minkoff-Zern argues that immigrant farmers, with their knowledge and experience of alternative farming practices, are&#x2015;despite a range of challenges&#x2015;actively and substantially contributing to the movement for an ecological and sustainable food system.

Leoni, a troubled teen from modern-day Los Angeles, and Ria, a young woman who lives in Stone Age Spain, meet in a parallel dimension outside the flow of time to stop Sulpa's spectacular, deadly materialization of the modern world.</p><p><i>Entangled</i> rides a growing wave of interest in parallel dimensions and imaginary worlds (<i>The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia</i>, and <i>The Golden Compass</i> are recent Hollywood examples) and will have immediate appeal to readers of Philip Pullman, Stephen King, Neil Gaiman, and Kate Mosse, among others.</p><p>But <i>Entangled</i> has the added merit of being grounded in solid anthropological and scientific research. Hancock calls on his years of research into cutting-edge issues, including the "Neanderthal Enigma," the nature of consciousness, the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics, parallel realms, time travel, and near-death and out-of-body experiences.</p></p><p>Graham Hancock is the author of <i>Fingerprints of the Gods, The Sign and the Seal, Underworld, Supernatural</i>, and other best-selling investigations of historical mysteries.Adeptly balancing a concern for harsh and complicated realities with a boundless talent for the fantastical, Hancock, author of popular history works such as the bestseller Fingerprints of the Gods, has created a fantasy realm where an epic struggle is underway. Two teenaged girls living 24,000 years apart are tasked by a beneficent being with putting a stop to the evil force embodied in Sulpa, a demon who has amassed a terrifying force of Stone Age warriors to carry out his plans. Central to these is the destruction of the Neanderthals, who here are spiritually superior beings with telepathic and healing powers. Hancock's draw on real anthropological and archaeological information is grounding and invigorating, and his supernatural additions are both internally coherent and satisfyingly trippy; one central premise is that out-of-body states such as those induced by certain drugs can actually transport one to other (real) dimensions and times. The march of endless cliffhangers is somewhat tiring, though, and one hopes that the simplistic portrayal of good and evil will be complicated in sequels, as it contributes to a fatiguing effect. Otherwise, Hancock has more than enough mythos, character, and tension to propel two further installments. (Oct.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

SO WE CAN ALL SEE the benefits to such an alliance,&#x201d; intoned the burly Orion at the head of the meeting table, his gaze taking in each of his two guests in turn. &#x201c;Working alone, the Vulcans were powerful enough to drive both of your organizations into retreat. Now they are part of a larger, even stronger Federation whose Starfleet patrols increasingly interfere with your efforts to stay in business. What better revenge,&#x201d; the green-skinned man went on in a polished baritone, &#x201c;than to form a partnership of our own to stand against them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The benefits of allying with your . . . employers are self-evident, Harrad-Sar,&#x201d; replied the Mazarite representative, Eldi Zankor. But then she sneered, the expression subtly stretching the scalloped flaps of skin that extended from her cheekbones to her ears. &#x201c;But what can Jofirek here provide us? The Vulcans drove his syndicate from Agaron while I was still learning to walk, and he&#x2019;s been struggling for relevance ever since!&#x201d; Despite the white hair of her temples and eyebrows, a typical trait of her species, Zankor was in the prime of her life, her ambition and ruthlessness&#x2014;and the government purge of her predecessors some years before&#x2014;allowing her to rise to the head of Mazar&#x2019;s crime syndicate at a precocious age.<br> <br>The same could not be said for the wizened, silver-maned Agaron who sat across from her, the characteristic vertical ridge that bisected his people&#x2019;s foreheads almost lost amid a sea of wrinkles. &#x201c;How dare you!&#x201d; he wheezed. &#x201c;My smuggling and narcotics connections span two sectors!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two or three systems in each sector, at best. Why would you even want this fossil in our alliance, Harrad-Sar? He&#x2019;d just be a drag on us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had forty years to rebuild my organization! Your group is still trying to pick up the pieces after the purge!&#x201d;<br> <br>Harrad-Sar spread his hands. &#x201c;Please, please, my friends,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Federation&#x2019;s strength comes from its unity&#x2014;its ability to set aside its members&#x2019; differences in pursuit of their mutual interests. Our respective syndicates will be better able to stand against them if we learn from their example. This joint venture can benefit from Jofirek&#x2019;s experience, the connections and markers he&#x2019;s accumulated over the decades, as well as from the fervor and resources of the Mazarite cartel.&#x201d;<br> <br>Watching through a pane of one-way glass from the next room, Navaar smiled at her slave&#x2019;s performance. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s doing well,&#x201d; the merchant princess purred, absently twirling a lock of her luxuriant black hair around a slender green finger.<br> <br>&#x201c;He always was a quick study,&#x201d; replied her sister D&#x2019;Nesh as a muscular male slave&#x2014;bigger and younger than Harrad-Sar, with fewer and less elaborate metal adornments piercing his bare scalp&#x2014;brushed her curly hair for her. &#x201c;I guess you were right not to kill him after all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew he had it in him to redeem himself for his failure.&#x201d; In her private thoughts, Navaar admitted the truth: the failure to capture Jonathan Archer all those years ago, in retaliation for his disruption of the Orion Syndicate&#x2019;s slave market on this very planet, had rested as much with herself and her sisters as with their chief slave. Not only had Archer&#x2019;s officers somehow managed to overcome the Three Sisters&#x2019; powerful pheromonal control, but Earth and its allies had learned the truth about Orion women: that they, or at least their most pheromonally potent elite lineages, were the actual rulers of Orion civilization rather than the slaves they pretended to be. On top of everything else, the Starfleet crew had crippled the warp drive of Harrad-Sar&#x2019;s ship and forced him and the Sisters to limp home at sublight; it had been nearly a year before their distress signals had reached another Orion ship, and the Sisters had spent much of that year punishing Harrad-Sar for his failure. D&#x2019;Nesh had wanted to tear out all his piercings and keep tearing until there was nothing left but a pile of bones and organs. Maras would have been happy to watch and join in; the youngest Sister was a woman of simple pleasures.<br> <br>But Navaar had recognized the truth: that they had simply been making Harrad-Sar the scapegoat for their own failure, driven by their fear of the consequences when they finally returned in disgrace. She had convinced her siblings that they would need to stick together more closely than ever to survive, to draw on their slaves&#x2019; loyalty to the fullest rather than discarding them and trying to start fresh. Harrad-Sar had recognized in turn&#x2014;with a little persuasion from his owners&#x2014;that his own best chances of survival had come from helping the Sisters survive, and if anything, it had been the bonds the four had formed during that long trek home that had enabled them to weather their disgrace, emerge stronger, and eventually rise to their current leadership roles in the Syndicate.<br> <br>&#x201c;Your arguments are all well and good,&#x201d; Jofirek was saying to Harrad-Sar, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;m too important to deal with middlemen. When do I get to meet your employers?&#x201d;<br> <br>Zankor scoffed. &#x201c;Restrain your lust, old man. Just the sight of them would probably give you a heart attack.&#x201d;<br> <br>Navaar smiled, both at the compliment and the irony. While the Sisters&#x2019; existence and importance were known to the higher-ups in other syndicates, few knew them on sight. Thus, Zankor and Jofirek were unaware that Maras was in the room with them, posing as one of the junior attendants who played a menial and generally decorative role in the proceedings&#x2014;while a massive, nearly nude male slave tended to Zankor&#x2019;s needs. Although Maras&#x2019;s skills, to put it kindly, were far more in the physical sphere than the mental, she knew enough to avoid getting too close to Zankor, aware that pheromones as potent as the Sisters&#x2019; could have an irritant effect on humanoid females. Zankor was confrontational enough without such a hormonal boost. But Maras sat near enough to Jofirek to make him aroused and suggestible, ensuring that he would do whatever Harrad-Sar asked in the Sisters&#x2019; name.<br> <br>Right now, Sar was assuring the old man that he was fully empowered to speak for the Syndicate. But Navaar was distracted by a grunt of displeasure from the being who stood to her left, also watching through the mirror. &#x201c;Something troubles you, Garos?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>Dular Garos turned his broad, gray-scaled face to hers. &#x201c;I share Zankor&#x2019;s skepticism about Jofirek&#x2019;s usefulness,&#x201d; the Malurian intoned in his deep, resonant voice. &#x201c;In fact, negotiating with either is a waste of time. Both their organizations are in ruins, struggling for relevance. What can they possibly provide you that the Raldul alignment cannot?&#x201d;<br> <br>Behind them, D&#x2019;Nesh laughed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re just jealous.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised at you, Garos,&#x201d; Navaar said with a gentler smile. &#x201c;You understand our long-term objectives as well as anyone. To beat the Federation at their own game, we need to enlarge our alliance, draw on every resource we can. We need to be able to strike at them from all sides.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; D&#x2019;Nesh added. &#x201c;And it can&#x2019;t hurt to have a couple of sacrificial beasts to throw their way if we need to.&#x201d;<br> <br>Garos threw her a skeptical look. &#x201c;Just so long as Maluria doesn&#x2019;t turn out to be the sacrifice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Garos, Garos,&#x201d; Navaar said, stroking his arm. &#x201c;Do you really think we would have revealed ourselves to you so openly if we didn&#x2019;t value you as our closest ally?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You only revealed yourselves to me because you know Malurians respond to dominant females.&#x201d; As always, he was frustratingly unmoved by her instinctive efforts at seduction. Not only did his reptilian origins make him immune to Orion pheromones, but Malurian males were irrevocably bonded to the large, polyandrous females who generally remained on their homeworld, Malur. Garos was an exile from Maluria&#x2014;the system containing Malur and its three colony planets&#x2014;and every action he took was driven by the hope of returning home in glory one day.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you have seen us do the same with others of sufficient importance. The Basileus from Sauria, for example.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only when he failed to accept me as your representative,&#x201d; Garos said with irritation, still stung by the humiliation of Maltuvis&#x2019;s dismissal.<br> <br>Navaar faced him squarely. &#x201c;What would reassure you of our commitment to our partnership with Raldul?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Perhaps your attention to a matter of higher priority,&#x201d; he replied.<br> <br>D&#x2019;Nesh gave him a cute pout with steel behind it. &#x201c;Such as?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Such as the situation with the Rigelian Trade Commission. The Lorillians and Axanar have been pressuring Rigel to enact more aggressive security and anti-piracy patrols in the Kandari Sector&#x2014;even to join the Federation so they can have Starfleet protection! The Commission has already invited the Federation in for talks. And if Rigel joins them, then others will be quick to follow.&#x201d; He gestured at the negotiators on the other side of the mirror. &#x201c;What good will it do to bring these minor players into our circle if the Federation nearly doubles its own size while our attention is elsewhere?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come, Garos,&#x201d; Navaar said. &#x201c;You worry too much about short-term concerns. We&#x2019;re playing a long game here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You may be. The Syndicate&#x2019;s territory is large enough that you can easily afford the loss if Rigel cracks down on crime and piracy in Kandari. But my alignment depends far more heavily on those revenues.&#x201d;<br> <br>Navaar smiled. &#x201c;And that is the benefit of our partnership! It lets us direct our attentions toward several goals at once. You are more than welcome to address the Rigel situation yourself if it troubles you so. We trust Raldul to have the skill and resources to carry out such a venture.&#x201d;<br> <br>Garos sneered. &#x201c;While you waste time playing seduction games with relics like these.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know better than that, my friend,&#x201d; Navaar told him, turning back to watch as both the crime lords finally acceded and affixed their thumbprints to the document of alliance. &#x201c;This is a small piece in a much larger puzzle. And other, far more important stratagems are already in motion.&#x201d;<br> <br>February 25, 2164<br> <br>Patorco Harbor, Narpra, Sauria (Psi Serpentis IV)<br> <br>Patorco had made Antonio Ruiz fall in love with darkness.<br> <br>The harbor city was built into a vast, partly submerged lava tube on the edge of Narpra&#x2019;s largest island, its homes and businesses carved into the living rock of the walls. Dozens of tiers of dwellings arched over harborside paths worn smooth by eight millennia of webbed footsteps, and over heavy wooden piers that could be pulled up to serve as dikes when Sauria&#x2019;s frequent, fierce storms flooded the cavern. Far overhead, Ruiz could glimpse the mesh of carefully bred, broad-leafed plants that spanned the gaps in the roof, filtering the sunlight during the day to shield the Saurians&#x2019; vast nocturnal eyes while storing its energy in a calorie-rich vegetable oil used as both a fuel and a culinary staple. But at this time of year, Psi Serpentis A was in the sky for only a third of a day at this latitude, and only the faint illumination of its distant red-dwarf companion, about as bright as a crescent moon on Earth, currently showed through the leaves.<br> <br>Yet the water shimmered, its bioluminescent algae casting a gentle blue glow up from the harbor. Overhead, highly polished sheets of gold, silver, and bronze, plus more modern mirrors, caught and redistributed the light from the harbor, while streetlamps full of bioluminescent insects added a mix of gentle hues to the light. It was dim by human standards; Ruiz and his fellow Federation consultants carried night-vision visors as a matter of course, and he made sure to spend a few hours a day in a bright room and take daily melatonin supplements to stave off darkness-induced depression. But in his months on Sauria, he had learned to make do with the crepuscular lighting the Saurians favored, so that he could see this city&#x2019;s beauty the way it was meant to be seen. Everything about this place was a triumph of engineering, both mechanical and biological. As an engineer himself, Ruiz had to appreciate that.<br> <br>Of course, the company was the other main draw. Narprans were an exuberant, friendly people, and they evoked those qualities in others. Ruiz certainly found Narpra more agreeable than M&#x2019;Tezir, the first Saurian nation where he and his fellow mining engineers had been sent to teach environmentally sound techniques. The geological forces that had created the narrow M&#x2019;Tezir continent&#x2014;essentially one vast mountain range thrusting out of the ocean&#x2014;had also brought the dilithium, duranium, and rare earths in the planet&#x2019;s mantle closer to the surface there than just about anywhere else on Sauria, making it the main focus of Federation mining efforts. But the new wealth the deal had brought to the formerly impoverished land mass had yet to trickle down to M&#x2019;Tezir&#x2019;s commoners, whom Ruiz had found furtive, somber, and wary of outsiders. Their ruler, an old-style warlord called Maltuvis, was making nice with the Federation and the Saurian Global League in order to profit from the trade agreement, but that hadn&#x2019;t yet extended to improving the way he treated his subjects&#x2014;people who hoarded what little they had and saw outsiders as potential competitors, a xenophobia that Maltuvis readily encouraged. Ruiz had been much happier upon relocating here to Narpra, a Global League member whose constituent islands arced between M&#x2019;Tezir&#x2019;s northern tip and the west coast of the planet&#x2019;s largest continent. Not only was the cooler climate more comfortable for Ruiz&#x2014;still tropical by Earth standards but not too different from his native Cuba&#x2014;but the social climate was far warmer. He and his colleagues had been readily incorporated into their Narpran prot�g�s&#x2019; social lives.<br> <br>Ruiz grinned as Redik&#x2019;s, the miners&#x2019; favorite sauna bar, came into view. The local miners had been bringing the humans here for weeks, and Ruiz had taken to it readily. The Saurians were already famous across the stars for their brandy, whose potent charms Ruiz appreciated, but he&#x2019;d developed a particular liking for Narpran rum, a dark and flavorful spirit distilled from a seaweed cultivated by local divers. He also had a definite fondness for the hot spring&#x2013;fueled sauna and steam room facilities in the back, particularly since Laila Alindogan partook of them regularly&#x2014;and was considerably more comfortable with the local custom of group nudity in saunas than Ruiz was. On more than a few occasions, the two of them had ended up going home together after a few lively hours drinking and sweating with their friends. (Not that Saurians sweated, of course, but they benefited from the heat and humidity in their own way.)<br> <br>But when the group entered Redik&#x2019;s this time, they found the mood oddly subdued, the patrons muttering quietly. Some threw furtive glances toward Ruiz, Laila, and the other offworlders as the group came up to the bar.

TOXIC HOME? <br> &nbsp;<br> When I was growing up, there was a plaque on my grandma&#x2019;s wall that said it all: This home is clean enough to be healthy, and dirty enough to be happy. <br> &nbsp;<br> Maybe you&#x2019;ve seen this saying on a decorative plate or framed needlepoint. It&#x2019;s still everywhere, and it would be a total clich� if it weren&#x2019;t so true. Creating a home environment that is healthy and happy is not about perfection and driving your family batshit crazy. It&#x2019;s about finding a balance between the choices that keep y&#x2019;all healthy and the sanity-preserving allowances that keep everybody happy too. <br> &nbsp;<br> In other words, do what you can and then just chill out. <br> &nbsp;<br> But here is some reality you need to understand. If you thought that the food and products you purchase are independently safety-tested before they hit the shelves, you are wrong. Your family is not protected the way you thought, and it has to do with what crazy chemicals y&#x2019;all are exposed to, day in and day out. Chemicals that, in many cases, are banned or restricted overseas, but here in the good old U.S. of A. end up on our dinner plates and in products inside our homes.1 Yes, there are rules and regulations governing this shit, but some of that bureaucratic mumbo jumbo is more about shielding manufacturers from legal liability than it is about looking out for you and your family&#x2014;so who&#x2019;s to say you&#x2019;re actually being protected? It also doesn&#x2019;t mean the powers that be have to tell you what they are <i>not</i> regulating for your safety. <br> &nbsp;<br> In some cases, you&#x2019;ve been flat-out lied to; in others, no one bothered to tell you about the fine print. And let&#x2019;s face it: Had someone pointed out that fine print, would you have really read it? You&#x2019;ve been a bit busy making awesomeness happen, and those sneaky chemical companies are banking on you being too busy to check that shit out. <br> &nbsp;<br> So what chemicals are we talking about, and where are they? The answer to that is complicated as fuck, but I&#x2019;m going to break it down for you. That is what this book is all about. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m here for you, girl. <br> &nbsp;<br> In today&#x2019;s world of seemingly endless options and totally relentless marketing, it has become more and more difficult to make good, careful choices. The supermarket has become a place of confusion for most people, and when you have a family to protect and care for, you need real answers, really quick. <br> &nbsp;<br> Well, my dear, you have come to the right place! I am here to end the confusion and get you started on the right track. <br> &nbsp;<br> Let&#x2019;s get a few things out of the way first. <br> &nbsp;<br> Full disclosure: I didn&#x2019;t used to be a &#x201c;green mom.&#x201d; You know, those total killjoys you encounter at playgrounds, parties, and everywhere you want to just relax. (&#x201c;Everything is toxic! Everything is giving us cancer! You can&#x2019;t do this because of that, and you can&#x2019;t do that because of this!&#x201d;) I hate to be told what to do, so I avoided green moms like the plague. Back in the day, I even worked for politicians who voted against regulations that would have helped protect our children and environment. My life was full of chemicals. I went green slowly, as I learned about chemical contamination in products and food and witnessed the avalanche of chronic disease and cancers, including in my own family. <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ve noticed something similar happen with your family and friends. People are dying and getting sick, and it&#x2019;s everywhere. <br> &nbsp;<br> Today, I&#x2019;m green enough, which means far from perfect, but light-years better than before. I&#x2019;m the founder of Mamavation, a mom-focused social-media community dedicated to cutting through the marketing bullshit and discovering what&#x2019;s truly healthy for ourselves, our families, and our environment. I&#x2019;m a rabble-rouser, and a speaker of truth to power, and I&#x2019;m here to help you find your way to a greener path. No judgment, just love and compassion&#x2014;plus need-to-know information leavened with a lot of humor and more than a few cuss words. <br> &nbsp;<br> I am challenging you to read this book and take action to make things better for yourself and your family; learn as much as you can and share your knowledge with your loved ones and friends; and also help make a difference with your dollar bills by buying more products from companies that are creating a better, healthier world. We will change the system through sharing knowledge and supporting the good guys who are doing things in a better way right now. <br> &nbsp;<br> And I&#x2019;ll tell you what this book is <i>not</i> about. This book has not been written to make you feel bad about how you are raising your family. How can I possibly look down on you when I used to eat fast food every single day? On the other hand, you ain&#x2019;t no badass in my book if you use any of this information to make other moms feel like shit. This book is about us all rising up together, each on her own timeline and in her own way. So take what you want and leave what you don&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t care. I just want you to have the information so you have <i>true</i> choices. <br> &nbsp;<br> We are going to update that corny but wise philosophy: This home is GREEN ENOUGH to be healthy, and CHILL enough to be happy. <br> &nbsp;<br> So buckle up, my friend. It is time to get real and get busy. <br> &nbsp;<br> TOXIC FOOD? TOXIC HOME? <br> What would you say if I told you . . . <br> &nbsp;<br> That cinnamon oat square cereal you bought because it&#x2019;s chockfull of fiber and protein is not only loaded with sugar&#x2014;more than 2 teaspoons per half-cup serving&#x2014;but also butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, a scary, petroleum-derived preservative that&#x2019;s banned in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and throughout Europe),2 genetically modified organisms (GMO) galore in the sweeteners, maybe some monosodium glutamate in that mystery &#x201c;flavor&#x201d; listed on the label, and potentially a huge dose of pesticides in the oats and wheat. <br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s un-freakin&#x2019;-believable, I&#x2019;d totally understand (personally, this makes me want to rip my hair out.) <br> &nbsp;<br> OR THIS: <br> &nbsp;<br> When you microwave that handy bag of popcorn, you are unleashing tons of toxic substances inherent in the packaging materials and chemicals that are strongly suspected of being potent hormone disrupters and carcinogens.3 <br> &nbsp;<br> If your response to the oh-so-convenient bag o&#x2019; hormone hackers and cancer is a big eye roll and a heavy sigh, I&#x2019;m right there with you. <br> &nbsp;<br> ALSO THIS: <br> &nbsp;<br> Ninety-nine percent of conventionally grown strawberries tested by the USDA in 2014 and 2015 came up positive for contamination with pesticides&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s after the berries were washed. On 20 percent of samples, the pesticides included a fungicide that has been banned in the European Union because of its intense toxicity.4 <br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a total horror show. <br> &nbsp;<br> PLUS THIS: <br> &nbsp;<br> Eighty-two percent of ground-turkey samples collected for a study in 2012 were contaminated with E. coli&#x2014;and more than half of the bacteria found on the ground turkey were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics, according to FDA scientists.5 <br> &nbsp;<br> Shrieking is totally understandable at this point, as are gagging noises. <br> &nbsp;<br> AND HOW ABOUT THIS: <br> &nbsp;<br> Ninety percent of household dust samples from multiple studies of American homes contain 10 harmful chemicals that may be linked to infertility, birth defects, autism, early puberty, obesity, diabetes, and hormone-related cancers, as well as a flame-retardant (TDCIPP) that is known to cause cancer. But wait, there&#x2019;s still more! One-hundred percent of the dust samples contained large amounts of substances called phthalates, which are believed to interfere with hormones in the body and are linked to declines in IQ and respiratory problems in children, poor sperm quality (among other reproductive problems), and many other health hazards.6 <br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d hazard a guess that you&#x2019;re mighty tempted to slap this book shut and go vacuum the bejesus out of your entire domicile. <br> &nbsp;<br> AND (LAST ONE. FOR NOW.): <br> &nbsp;<br> Most shampoo, soap, lotion, and other personal care products we slather all over ourselves and our children on a daily basis contain hormone-disrupting chemicals that have been linked to asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obesity, type 2 diabetes, low IQ, neurodevelopmental issues, behavioral issues, autism spectrum disorders, breast cancer, altered reproductive development, and male genital defects and fertility problems. These chemicals are called phthalates. And they only rarely are listed on product labels.7 <br> &nbsp;<br> Are you thinking, Leah, could just shut up?! I feel ya. But no. <br> &nbsp;<br> If it sounds like I&#x2019;m telling you that your food and the packages it comes in are polluted, and so are your home and your family&#x2019;s personal care products, that&#x2019;s because I am. These everyday toxic exposures we are contending with add up, eventually burdening our bodies with a toxic load that can lead to serious health problems. <br> &nbsp;<br> The good news is that there are a lot of reasonably easy ways that you can dial your family&#x2019;s toxic load way down. <br> &nbsp;<br> First, we&#x2019;ll cover everything you need to know to get smart about your food choices, including issues about processed food and food packaging (Chapters 1 and 2, respectively), followed by produce, meat, and dairy (Chapters 3 and 4). Chapter 5 is all about setting you up with great foods and easy ways to prepare them. Then comes Chapter 6, a room-by-room guide to reducing toxic exposures at home. Finally, there&#x2019;s Chapter 7, where I&#x2019;ll help you navigate the treacherous terrain of personal care products. <br> &nbsp;<br> If you want to get right to the part where we open up a can of whoopass on those toxic exposures, just turn to page 208. <br> &nbsp;<br> However, if you want more background on what kind of chemicals we&#x2019;re concerned about here; how they&#x2019;re getting into our food, our household items, and our grooming products; how little we are protected by the powers that be; and what the potential health consequences are, then dig in to the rest of this chapter. <br> &nbsp;<br> This is where I&#x2019;m going to get you acquainted with the main chemical offenders and important details on exactly how they threaten your health. I&#x2019;ll also dish up some dirt on chemical companies and the government agencies that are falling down on the job of protecting you and your family, or straight-up ignoring it. Basically, I&#x2019;m going to give you a whole slew of reasons to get serious about lightening your family&#x2019;s toxic load&#x2014;complete with some seriously scary science. You can refer back to this information as you make your way through the practical steps you&#x2019;ll get into in the chapters that follow. <br> &nbsp;<br> So, are you ready to kick the toxic shit to the curb? Brace yourself. (And I wouldn&#x2019;t discourage you from pausing to pour yourself a glass of organic wine, either.) <br> &nbsp;<br> HELLO, HAZMATS <br> From preservatives, flavorings, and fragrances to pesticides, plasticizers, and flame retardants, there are thousands upon thousands of synthetic chemicals in the products we consume and use on a daily basis&#x2014;more than 85,000, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The vast majority of these chemicals have not been proven safe for human and environmental health.8 In fact, every day we are learning about more chemicals that are more dangerous than they are useful. Mind you, a chemical doesn&#x2019;t have to be synthetic to be dangerous&#x2014;lead, arsenic, and mercury are just a few examples of naturally occurring elements that cause grievous harm. <br> &nbsp;<br> Basically, we live in a toxic soup, and still we wonder why so many people are having trouble conceiving children, so many others are dropping dead of cancer, and chronic disease is becoming so prevalent among young children that our offspring have been dubbed &#x201c;Generation Rx.&#x201d; Check out these seriously scary stats (as of 2017): <br> &nbsp;<br> 1 in 3 children are overweight9 <br> 1 in 6 children have a learning disability10 <br> 1 in 9 children have asthma11 <br> 1 in 10 children have ADHD12 <br> 1 in 13 children have food allergies13 <br> 1 in 27 male children have autism14 <br> &nbsp;<br> What the actual hell is going on here? <br> &nbsp;<br> PUBLIC ENEMY NO. 1: ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS <br> The chemical culprits I am going to give top billing to here and throughout this book are endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), substances that, depending on the chemical, interfere with hormones and sometimes entire hormone systems. <br> &nbsp;<br> We tend to think of hormones mostly as important factors in sexual development and reproduction. Well, they&#x2019;re certainly vital in those ways, but it goes way beyond that. <br> &nbsp;<br> If you thought the brain was unilaterally responsible for ruling the rest of the body, guess again. The endocrine system is an exquisitely complex and finely tuned system that works at a grassroots level to control the body&#x2019;s other systems, which in turn deal with the business of vital functions such as development, growth, metabolism, immune response, reproduction, intelligence, and behavior. To manage this feat, the endocrine system uses a variety of chemical messengers, including hormones. <br> &nbsp;<br> If these chemical messengers could be hijacked, just imagine the severity and extent of the mayhem that could ensue. Unfortunately it&#x2019;s not a matter of if, but when&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s going down in our bodies. <br> &nbsp;<br> These hijackers are devious; they mimic, thwart, disorient, and otherwise interfere with hormones, and they can change the way our cells develop and grow. Some of these chemicals mess with sexual development. Certain ones can diminish intelligence and derail behavior. Others have the potential to throw our metabolic function and/or immune systems out of whack.15, 16 <br> &nbsp;<br> In terms of fertility, the consequences can be horrendous. Men may have declines in sperm count, increases in malformed sperm, and sperm that lack the requisite swimming skills to get the job done.17 Worldwide, sperm counts have tanked by as much as 50 percent in recent decades, while rates of testicular cancer have surged.18 In women, endocrine disruption can cause egg production or ovulation to malfunction, pregnancy to terminate, or fetal development to go awry. Hormone-related cancers, endometriosis, and other reproductive disorders are on the upswing among women.19 <br> &nbsp;<br> For those fortunate enough to conceive, there are grave concerns about chemicals that can pass through the placenta and/or can be passed from mother to infant through breast milk. In the womb, exposure to EDCs during pregnancy can be dire because hormones play a programming role during fetal development, and the damage is irreversible if this is tampered with at such an early stage.20 For example, the entire male sexual-differentiation process depends upon certain hormones (androgens) arriving on the scene during a very specific window of time. Any interference&#x2014;which can happen when the mother is exposed to phthalates via plastic food containers and fragrances, among many other things&#x2014;has been linked to increased incidence of undescended testicles and malformations of the pen...</p><h2>Success The Psychology of Achievement: A Practical Guide to Unlocking You Potential in Every Area of Life</h2><p><p><i>Success: The Psychology of Achievement</i> is a dynamic infographic guide that equips you with the tools you need to drive yourself toward success, whether you are seeking improvement in your career, relationships, or in your overall performance.</p><p>Give your confidence a boost, master your resources, and raise your self-awareness with proven psychological strategies and expert advice.

Six of these things are discussed in this book. This limited (and arbitrary) sampling is intended to emphasize how, in totality, the work of artists has a substance, spirit, and methodology different from that found in most other types of work. Highlights from the lives of seminal 20th-century artists are used to illustrate these six things.&nbsp;</p><p>Leonard Koren trained as an artist and architect. In 1976 he created "WET: The Magazine of Gourmet Bathing," an avant-garde publication that was influential in the development of postmodern aesthetics. Subsequently Koren has written numerous books including "Wabi-Sabi: for Artists, Designers, Poets &amp; Philosophers," the classic&nbsp; volume on the beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete.For the past three decades, Leonard Koren has been quietly publishing elegant, thoughtful books wherein he writes simply and directly about the often complex subjects of art and aesthetics. He designs his own books, including the typeface, and they're special objects in and of themselves.&nbsp;<i>What Artists Do</i>, Koren's latest project, examines why and how artists create their art, using the work of six seminal conceptual artists--including Donald Judd, John Cage, and Christo and Jeanne Claude--to illustrate his ideas. It's a slim, focused volume, perfect for those looking to think more intentionally about an artist's vision and the execution thereof. --The AV Club<br><br>The Tate Museums (London) book of the month (December 2018).</p><h2>When the Nazis Came to Skokie (Landmark Law Cases &amp; American Society)</h2><p>In the Chicago suburb of Skokie, one out of every six Jewish citizens in the late 1970s was a survivor&#x2014;or was directly related to a survivor&#x2014;of the Holocaust. These victims of terror had resettled in America expecting to lead peaceful lives free from persecution. But their safe haven was shattered when a neo-Nazi group announced its intention to parade there in 1977. Philippa Strum's dramatic retelling of the events in Skokie (and in the courts) shows why the case ignited such enormous controversy and challenged our understanding of and commitment to First Amendment values. <br><br>The debate was clear-cut: American Nazis claimed the right of free speech while their Jewish "targets" claimed the right to live without intimidation. The town, arguing that the march would assault the sensibilities of its citizens and spark violence, managed to win a court injunction against the marchers. In response, the American Civil Liberties Union took the case and successfully defended the Nazis' right to free speech. <br><br>Skokie had all the elements of a difficult case: a clash of absolutes, prior restraint of speech, and heated public sentiment. In recreating it, Strum presents a detailed account and analysis of the legal proceedings as well as finely delineated portraits of the protagonists: Frank Collin, National Socialist Party of America leader and the son of a Jewish Holocaust survivor; Skokie community leader Sol Goldstein, a Holocaust survivor who planned a counterdemonstration against the Nazis; Skokie mayor Albert Smith, who wanted only to protect his townspeople; and ACLU attorney David Goldberger, caught in the ironic position of being a Jew defending the rights of Nazis against fellow Jews. While the ACLU did win the case, it was a costly victory-30,000 of its members left the organization. And in the end, ironically, the Nazis never did march in Skokie. <br><br>Forcefully argued, Strum's book shows that freedom of speech must be defended even when the beneficiaries of that defense are far from admirable individuals. It raises both constitutional and moral issues critical to our understanding of free speech and carries important lessons for current controversies over hate speech on college campuses, inviting readers to think more carefully about what the First Amendment really means.</p><p>"A meticulous and graceful narrative of one of the most gripping free speech conflicts of modern times."--Rodney A. Smolla, author of <i>Free Speech in an Open Society</i> <p>"Strum succeeds brilliantly in telling the two stories of Skokie-the constitutional struggle over free speech and the human agony and conflict that permeated it. In clear, rigorous, and vivid prose, she recreates the legal and political culture when the case arose in the 1970s and then shows how more recent intellectual theories bear on what happened. A simply wonderful book."--Norman Dorsen, Stokes Professor, NYU, and president, ACLU, 1976-1991 </p><p>"Strum paints a remarkably complete picture of the entire Skokie controversy and helps put the debate over the First Amendment protection for 'hate speech' into meaningful perspective."--David Goldberger, Ohio State University College of Law professor and former ACLU attorney for Frank Collin and the National Socialist Party of America </p><p>"A book that students will read eagerly and that teachers will find a pleasure to use."--Melvin I.

Whether it&#x2019;s mountaineering, running ultramarathons, or just sitting by a stream, she finds her spirituality and Judaism thrive most in the wilderness. In her work as the Adventure Rabbi, leading groups toward spiritual fulfillment in the outdoors, Korngold has uncovered the rich traditions and lessons God taught our ancestors in the wild. In <i>God in the Wilderness</i> Korngold uses rabbinic wisdom and witty insights to guide readers through the Bible, showing people of all faiths that, despite the hectic pace of life today, it is vital for us to reclaim these lessons, awaken our inner spirituality, and find meaning, tranquillity, and purpose in our lives.</p></p><p><p>JAMIE KORNGOLD is a Reform Jewish rabbi. She started the Adventure Rabbi program in 2001 and has become nationally known for her pioneering work integrating spirituality and the outdoors. She was ordained at Hebrew Union College. She lives in Boulder, Colorado, with her husband and two daughters.</p><b>CHAPTER 1<br><br>Cultivate the Patience to See Burning Bushes</b><br><i>Moses said, "I must turn aside to look at this marvelous sight; why doesn't the bush burn up?" When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush: "Moses! Moses!"</i><br>&#x2014;Exodus 3:3-4<br>Almost all of us know the story of the burning bush. Moses is out tending his father-in-law's flock when he notices an amazing sight--a bush that burns but is not consumed. He stops to look at it, and God appears to him from the flame. This is the first time that Moses meets God "face-to-face." God taps Moses as the man to free the Israelites and receive the Ten Commandments, and from there on, it's all history.<br><br>But what if the story had gone differently? What if it went something a little bit more like this: Moses is tending the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian. He drives the flock into the wilderness and comes to Horeb, the mountain of God. He had always found that place relaxing, although he never thought much about why, and since Moses has a lot on his mind this particular morning, he decides Horeb is, as always, a good place to sort through his thoughts.<br><br>Moses thinks through the day ahead. As soon as he has tended to the flock, he needs to rush back to the tent, change into his dress robes, and catch a caravan into the city, because he has a packed day of meetings ahead of him. He is trying to figure out how he can get all his work done in time to get to the gym that night, and still get home before his son Gershom goes to sleep, when his eye catches a marvelous sight! There is a bush all aflame, yet the bush is not being consumed by the fire. Moses says, "I must turn aside to look at this marvelous sight; why doesn't the bush burn up?"<br><br>Just then his cell phone vibrates. He grabs the phone out of his robe pocket. It is a text message from his friend Nathan, who always seems to know what is going on a few days before anyone else. Moses reads, "Wool futures 2 go up. Don't sell 2day. Call L8r. N8." By the time Moses has read the message, he is well past the bush and has already forgotten about the odd flames. With the phone still in hand, he calls his wife, Zipporah, just to check in.<br><br>Five minutes later, when he gets off the phone, he remembers the miraculous burning bush, but it is already well behind him. He thinks of going back but realizes that then he won't have time to stop for a cup of coffee, so he calls the fire department, which sends a crew to put out the fire.<br><br>Thus for a short time Moses became a local hero for saving the wilderness from burning down. Meanwhile, God tried the burning bush routine a few more times, but eventually God realized that no one had time to notice the subtle miracle and scribbled a quick note: "Note to Self: Command these people to take a day off every week so they have time to notice my miracles!" Then God switched to e-mail. But unfortunately, everyone thought God's messages were spam, and deleted them. So ends the story of the Israelites. The Bible never progresses past the burning bush scene of Exodus 3:3, well before the freeing of the Israelites from slavery, the parting of the Red Sea, and the awe-inspiring moment on Sinai, culminating with the giving of the Ten Commandments.<br><br>The rabbis teach us that the striking part of Moses' behavior in the burning bush story, in its original form, is that he takes the time to notice that the bush is burning but not being consumed. It takes patience to notice that something is on fire but not burning up, because you have to actually sit with it for a while to observe the changes, or lack thereof.<br><br>The Bible says, "When the Lord saw that he had turned aside to look, God called to him out of the bush" (Exodus 3:4), stressing that it is not until God sees that Moses turns aside that God actually speaks, as if this was the actual test. Will Moses notice? Will he take the time to stop and observe this peculiar sight?<br><br>Today our lives are so frenetic that, like Moses in the "what-if" version, we rarely have time to catch our breath, let alone be alert for spiritual portals or miracles. One of the reasons many of us love the desert is that when we are surrounded by the vast vistas, the sparse vegetation, and the bold colored rocks, we do have time to stop and notice. Out "there" we are able to remove ourselves from everything that normally demands our attention&#x2014;e-mail, cell phones, voice mail, laundry, to-do lists, breaking news, not such breaking news, carpools, schedules, figuring out what we should make for dinner, and on and on. Perhaps the spirituality many of us experience outdoors is created by the simple fact that we are less distracted, so we are able to be deeply attentive to what is around us as well as what is inside us.<br><br>Throughout the Bible, theophany (God appearing to humans) does not occur just in the wilderness, but it usually does. (*) Perhaps God did try to show up in the towns or cities, but there was so much tumult&#x2014;people coming and going, merchants hawking their wares, kids playing running games, friends shouting greetings&#x2014;that no one noticed God.<br><br>One message of the burning bush story is that spiritual awareness involves slowing down and waking up to the world around us. I am not suggesting that if we slow down and take time to look, listen, and notice that we will actually meet God face-to-face, because according to Jewish tradition since the end of the prophetic age, God no longer makes direct contact with humanity.<br><br>But I believe we still have opportunities to meet the Divine (whatever you believe that to be), because in the wilderness, we connect with That Which Is Greater Than Ourselves (one of my favorite names for God), and we are embraced by a sense of belonging, of oneness, and of peace.<br><br>I know that it's not always possible (or even desirable) to relocate to the middle of the desert for a month. For people who live in the city, the closest you might get to the wilderness is an urban park. But even there you can cultivate the patience to see burning bushes and open yourself to spiritual opportunity. One of my favorite "tools" for slowing down, taking notice, and being fully present is a short sensory meditation that can be done anywhere. Let me share with you how it worked on an Adventure Rabbi hike I was leading on the trails above Boulder, Colorado.<br><br>A group of forty people had gathered for one of our monthly Sabbath hikes. My task, in two hours, was to give the group a chance to separate from their workweeks, to slow down and catch up with themselves. Ultimately the goal was for them to taste "Sabbath rest."<br><br>There was a palpable buzz as we hiked up the trail--the excitement of people who were meeting for the first time and were not sure of what to expect. The steep red rocks ahead of us, jutting skyward above Boulder, had a luminous rosy glow to them, unique to the early-morning hours. The small wildflowers of early spring poked courageously from the still cold ground, and here and there pockets of snow still clung to the rocks. Early morning in Colorado is a glorious time for those who are awake!<br><br>As we hiked, I invited the group to try to consciously slow down their minds and shift into their "Sabbath souls," to allow themselves to experience the calmness and grace that surrounded us. As I listened to the talk on the trail, though, I realized that not only was the shift not happening but members of my group were not even noticing much of the natural scenery they were passing. Their workweeks were too entrenching, still demanding thought and attention, and their conversations with others on the trail were too compelling.<br><br>I stopped the group at a large rock outcrop, to try to readjust. As they sat down to rest, I read them the burning bush story. They immediately pointed out how hard it is to be like Moses today, to be fully present, to be here and now. Then we discussed how difficult it can be, even here in the outdoors, surrounded by nature, to stop our brain wheels from turning.<br><br>Then I introduced one of my favorite mind-focusing exercises, and the group agreed to try it. Each person would focus quietly on either listening or seeing for ten minutes, after which time we would share what we had noticed.<br><br>Ten minutes went by, uncomfortably at first and then, all of a sudden, too quickly. When the time was almost over, I slid my backpacker guitar out of my backpack. Quietly, I began to play "Oseh Shalom," a Jewish prayer for peace. Those who had wandered off to sit elsewhere made their way back to the rock, so that we were all sitting in a circle, and gradually the group joined me in song. Forty voices singing together, the ancient Hebrew words linking us together.<br><br>"So what did you notice?" I asked my now very chilled-out group.<br><br>"I noticed," said Greg, "how loud it was. I mean at first when we stopped talking it was really quiet, but after a while I noticed all these sounds I didn't hear before, and it was really loud."<br><br>Kate said, "I hadn't heard a single bird while we hiked. But when I was quiet I heard chickadees, robins, and cardinals and lots of bird sounds I didn't even recognize."<br><br>"I didn't realize how close we were to the road," said Steve. "It seemed so far away, but it was much louder than I thought it was."<br><br>The people who focused on the sense of sight during their ten minutes joined in.<br><br>Mark said, "At first I was disappointed that I had sat on the rock instead of in the meadow where all the flowers are. But after a while I noticed that there are several different lichens growing here, and the greens are all different, and quite beautiful."<br><br>"I was really taken by the textures. I was sitting under a ponderosa pine, and the bark falls off in these really cool patterns," said Anita.<br><br>David added, "I sat in the meadow and I was amazed at how many different types of grasses there are. I thought it would be just one kind of grass, but really there are quite a few."<br><br>Amazingly, we all seemed to share the experience "At first I thought one thing, but after I sat for a while I noticed something else." In order to be like Moses and truly notice what is directly in front of us, we learned that we needed to sit quietly for a while, to observe, and to become fully present.<br><br>As we continued up the trail, a feeling of tranquility permeated the group. Conversations shifted, and some people chose to hike silently. At last, most of us were fully present in the experience.<br><br>When we reached our destination, a natural sanctuary, we gathered in a circle and joined together in traditional Sabbath prayers. Then, after the last exhalation of sound had drifted over the foothills, we sat in silence for a long time. As I looked around the group, I saw that everyone's faces appeared less strained, and their shoulders had finally relaxed.<br><br>And as we hiked down the trail, I heard snippets of conversations: "What a difference it makes when you really slow down and notice what is around you!"<br><br>"That was the first time I've ever said a prayer and felt anything."<br><br>"I didn't know that Judaism could be so powerful."<br><br>"Too bad the congregation can't have their sanctuary up here! It would be so easy to pray!"<br><br>I privately gave thanks for this amazing trail, for rocks and flowers, for grasses and birds, for this experience that gave these forty people an opportunity to open their eyes, ears, and souls to the wonder of Creation. Their journey toward cultivating the patience to see burning bushes had begun.<br><br>I have repeated this simple yet powerful exercise countless times, seated and walking, outside and indoors. Although I love doing the exercise while hiking, it works indoors as well. I recently tried it with a group inside a sanctuary with wondrous results. What do you notice after gazing at your hand or listening to your own heartbeat for five minutes?<br><br>Heightened awareness is the first step toward engaging the spiritual possibility that continually surrounds us. It is accessible to us whether we live in Manhattan or Montana. Cultivate the patience to see burning bushes. You will be amazed at the wonders you discover. When we marvel at the world around us, we prepare to meet the miracles that await us, around most every corner.<br><b>CHAPTER 2</b><br><b>Take the First Step, the Sea May Part</b><br><i>As the Israelites were departing defiantly, the Egyptians gave chase to them, and all the chariot horses of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his warriors overtook them encamped by the sea</i>...<i><br></i>&#x2014;Exodus 14:8-9<br>God's best, all-out, no-holds-barred miracle had to be the splitting of the Red Sea. In contrast with the burning bush, there was nothing subtle about this miracle. Just as Pharaoh's army is about to catch up with the Israelites and wipe them off the face of the earth, God parts the sea, allowing the Israelites to escape to the other side. Talk about God showing up at the right time, in the right place! This seaside appearance ranks number one on my list of top-ten miracles.<br><br>Do you ever wonder what happened to all the miracles? When I read the stories of the Bible, I sometimes think, "Why were there miracles then and not now? Couldn't God muster a little miracle today&#x2014;to cure cancer or broker peace for Israel?" As Tevye asked in Fiddler on the Roof, "Would it spoil some big eternal plan?" For thousands of years, other people have read these same Bible stories and they too must have asked, "Why were there miracles then and not now? Has God deserted us? Where is God when we need a miracle?"<br><br>Theologians and other people who contemplate these sorts of questions offer us a variety of answers, including these: "The biblical miracles are myths to learn from. They didn't really happen." Or "In order for us to have free will, God can't intervene in our lives." Or "We don't deserve miracles from God. Our faith isn't strong enough."<br><br>So, if God doesn't do miracles anymore, why do we spend so much time learning about them? Perhaps there are other lessons embedded in the miracle stories that are still relevant and meaningful today. Let's take a closer look at one of the more well-known miracles of the Bible to see what we can uncover.<br><br>Many of us grew up watching Charlton Heston parting the Red Sea each spring when the movie The Ten Commandments was on TV, so you probably remember the story line. After countless bargaining sessions with Moses, Pharaoh finally relented and acquiesced to God's demand: "Let My people go!"<br><br>Thus ended four hundred years of enslavement. Moses and his brother Aaron led the 600,000 men out of Egypt, with their women, children, flocks, and herds. Hastily, they set out across desert sands, triumphantly fleeing the taskmasters who had forced them to build Pharaoh's cities of Pithom and Raamses (Exodus 1:11). They were in such a hurry that they didn't even have time to let their bread rise, which is why Jewish people commemorate the exodus from Egypt each spring by eating unleavened bread called matzoh.<br><br>But barely a biblical chapter goes by before Pharaoh and his courtiers have a change of heart and wonder, "What is this thing we have done, releasing Israel from our service?" (Exodus 14:5). Pharaoh frantically sends off all his best chariots, along with the rest of his chariots (it really says that in the Bible!) and his horsemen and his warriors to pursue the bedraggled slaves.<br><br>The defenseless Israelites, camped down by the shores of the sea, are suddenly trapped between Pharaoh's oncoming army and the relentless waves of the sea. Certain that they are about to be driven into the sea by the oncoming Egyptian army, the people complain bitterly to God, "Why did you take us out of Egypt just to die in ...</p><h2>Smith Wigglesworth on Faith</h2><p>Smith Wigglesworth was a man who simply took God at His word, and God used his faith as a model for others.

Harrison delivers an extraordinary, genre-bending novel that weaves together mythology, sexuality, and the troubled past and present of Eastern Europe. It begins on a hot May night, when three Cambridge students carry out a ritualistic act that changes their lives. Years later, none of the participants can remember what exactly transpired; but their clouded memories can't rid them of an overwhelming sense of dread. Pam Stuyvesant is an epileptic haunted by strange sensual visions. Her husband Lucas believes that a dwarfish creature is stalking him. Self-styled Sorcerer Yaxley becomes obsessed with a terrifyingly transcendent reality. The seemingly least effected participant in the ritual (who is haunted by the smell of roses) attempts to help his friends escape the torment that has engulfed their lives.<br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.

John Harrison, is an English author and critic. His work includes the <i>Viriconium</i> sequence of novels and short stories, (1982), <i>Climbers</i> (1989), and the <i>Kefahuchi Tract</i> series which begins with Light (2002).<br>An unspoken secret that warps the lives of three Cambridge graduates is a springboard into mysteries of the heart and spirit in British author Harrison's enigmatic dark fantasy. Lucas Medlar, Pam Stuyvesant and the novel's unnamed narrator are all middle-aged intellectuals mired in the entropy of their lives. Lucas and Pam are in a deteriorating marriage, and the narrator uses work as a refuge from family and friends. All three are beholden to Yaxley, a creepy acquaintance from their schooldays who shows up periodically, always speaking in metaphysical riddles about a sensual realm called "the Pleroma." Meanwhile, Lucas entertains Pam with a fanciful history of "the Coeur," a symbol-laden quest that spans centuries and continents and is linked to the understanding of the Pleroma. The meaning of the Pleroma and the Coeur, and how they relate to visions of awe and terror that taunt all three characters over the course of the story, are just part of the weird aura that cloaks all the novel's events and points back to a strange shared experience from their youth. Harrison (<i>Things That Never Happen</i>) tantalizes the reader with explanations that are always just out of reach, and this sense of imminent revelation heightens the tale's mystery and suspense. Readers who like fantasies tinged with the transcendent will find much to enjoy. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For Danny, a Yale junior, it means two weeks behind the wheel of the Roach Coach, his father's lunch truck, which plies the parking lots of office parks in central New Jersey. </p><p>But Danny can use the time behind the coffee urn to try and make sense of a love life that's gotten a little complicated. There's loyal and patient hometown honey Cindy and her recently dropped bombshell to contend with. And there's also lissome Polly back in New Haven--with her shifting moods, perfect thrift store dresses and inconvenient liaison with a dashing professor.</p><p>If girl problems aren't enough, there's the constant menace of the Lunch Monsters, a group of thugs who think Danny has planted the Roach Coach in their territory.</p><p><i>Joe College </i>is Tom Perrotta's warmest and funniest fiction yet, a comic journey into the dark side of love, higher education and food service.</p></p><p>Having penned <i>Election</i>, a great novel of high-school manners, Tom Perrotta gives us <i>Joe College</i>, a great novel about college mores. In 1982, one Yale junior struggles with George Eliot, dorm blanket bingo, dining-hall dish-line duty, a massive crush on a girl in love with his favorite prof, daily cards and calls from a girl back home in New Jersey, and a lush profusion of authentically individual yet instantly recognizable undergrad eccentrics. After an evening of ritualistic bong hits, kimchee feasting, and sympathetic discussion of Leon Czolgosz, the anarchist who shot President McKinley, Danny thinks of his parents: "Was this what they scrimped and sacrificed for all those years? So their son could spend his Tuesday nights drinking beer, smoking dope, eating weird food, and learning to see the assassin's side of the story?"<p> Yup, that's the way it was, and Perrotta's immense strength is to give moment-by-moment immediacy to his hero's tortuous internal monologue. Instead of dumping his Jersey girl, Danny figures, "if I avoided her long enough, she'd get tired of waiting and supply my half of the conversation on her own, thereby sparing me the unpleasantness of having to be the bad guy." Yet he is also capable of heroism, as when he impulsively defies no-neck Mafiosi who menace his dad's "Roach Coach" lunch truck, which Danny drives to blue-collar work sites during school breaks. What gives the story structure is the collision in our hero's soul between his former life and the world of towers, moats, and upward mobility. He can't quite identify with his hometown reverence for Bruce Springsteen, but it rubs him wrong to see Springsteen LPs played "for the enjoyment of people who were going to end up being the bosses of the people the Boss was singing about. Nobody in Entryway C was born to run."</p><p> <i>Election</i> may have a better plot, but <i>Joe College</i> scoots along like a waterskeeter on a marvelous stream of consciousness.

Moreover, Jesus' radical Jewish ethics, rather than a new theology, distinguished him and his followers from other Jews. <br><br> It was the earliest followers of Jesus, the Jewish Christians, who understood Jesus better than any of the gentile Christian groups, which are the spiritual ancestors of modern Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox churches. In this detailed and accessible study, Keith Akers uncovers the history of Jewish Christianity from its origins in the Essenes and John the Baptist, through Jesus, until its disappearance into Islamic mysticism sometime in the seventh or eighth century. <br><br> Akers argues that only by really understanding this mysterious and much misunderstood strand of early Christianity can we get to the heart of the radical message of Jesus of Nazareth.</p><p><b>Keith Akers</b> is the author of <i>A Vegetarian Sourcebook: The Nutrition, Ecology, and Ethics of a Natural Foods Diet</i>. He has been involved with various vegetarian groups for over a quarter of a century, and currently runs the group Denver Vegans. He lives in Denver, Colorado with his wife, author Kate Lawrence.Other scholars have explored this field and several significant studies have been published, but none of them has the impact this one has....Akers presents nothing less than an entire recasting of Christian origins, as well as a whole new conception of Christianity.&#x2015;<b>Walter Wink</b><br><br> "An important, timely book that sets the historic record straight."&#x2015;<b>Tom Regan</b>, author of <i>Empty Cages</i><br><br> "In this scholarly historical work, Keith Akers seeks to rediscover the Jesus who said: 'Nobility is no more than humble service to the Creator and kindness to all creatures.'

This book could change forever our understanding of the true religion and teachings of Jesus."&#x2015;<b>Lewis Regenstein</b>, author, <i>Replenish the Earth</i><br><br> "<b>The Lost Religion of Jesus</b> is a groundbreaking, timely, and important book. It can help us shift the current dialogue about Christian fundamentalism to the fundamentals of what Jesus really taught. Based on ignored writings by and about the Jewish followers of Jesus, Keith Akers has put together compelling evidence that the core teachings of Jesus&#x2015;caring, compassion, simple living, and nonviolence against both humans and animals&#x2015;remained at the core of the early Jewish communities that saw Jesus as he saw himself, as a Jewish prophet. <br><br> "Akers also documents how these Jewish communities were later deemed heretic by the 'orthodox' Church, as it built a new religious hierarchy that eventually allied itself with the despotic Roman Emperor Constantine. He challenges us to re-examine the theology that Paul and other gentile Christians superimposed on the original teachings of Jesus, showing how this distortion of Jesus and his message led to the oppression and bloodshed that has historically been committed in the name of Christianity. He also shows the urgent relevance of Jesus's real teachings to the social and environmental crises of our time."&#x2015;<b>Riane Eisler</b>, author, <i>The Chalice and the Blade</i><br><br> "Both deep and beautifully clear, lively and a pleasure to read.

Drifting between the Old South and new West, Sherman witnessed firsthand many of the critical events of early nineteenth-century America: the Mexican War, the gold rush, the banking panics, and the battles with the Plains Indians. It wasn't until his victory at Shiloh, in 1862, that Sherman assumed his legendary place in American history. After Shiloh, Sherman sacked Atlanta and proceeded to burn a trail of destruction that split the Confederacy and ended the war. His strategy forever changed the nature of warfare and earned him eternal infamy throughout the South.<p>Sherman's&nbsp;<i>Memoirs</i>&nbsp;evoke the uncompromising and deeply complex general as well as the turbulent times that transformed America into a world power. This Penguin Classics edition includes a fascinating introduction and notes by Sherman biographer Michael Fellman.</p></p><p><b>William Tecumseh Sherman</b> (1820&#x2013;1891) was a renowned general of the Union Army during the American Civil War. Credited with the saying "War is hell" and a staunch advocate for total war, Sherman was a longtime companion of Ulysses S. Grant. His reputation as a skilled military strategist arose from his leadership in campaigns such as the Battle of Shiloh and the 60,000-man March to the Sea, weakening the resolve of the South and paving the way to victory for the Union Army. After Grant became president in 1869, Sherman took over as general commander of the US Army, a position which he held until he retired in 1884.<br><br><b>Michael Fellman</b> was a prolific historian of the nineteenth-century United States and a professor emeritus of history at Simon Fraser University in Canada.

After surviving the shoot-down of his reconnaissance plane and his capture on May 1, 1960, Powers endured sixty-one days of rigorous interrogation by the KGB, a public trial, a conviction for espionage, and the start of a ten-year sentence. After nearly two years, the U.S. government obtained his release from prison in a dramatic exchange for convicted Soviet spy Rudolph Abel. The narrative is a tremendously exciting suspense story about a man who was labeled a traitor by many of his countrymen but who emerged a Cold War hero.</p><p>The incident that wrecked a summit conference and inaugurated a new era in the ancient art of spyingFrancis Gary Powers served as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force and completed twenty-seven U-2 photographic reconnaissance missions for the CIA, including several overflights of the Soviet Union, until shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile on May 1, 1960.

Their wager on the future prices of five metals captured the public&#x2019;s imagination as a test of coming prosperity or doom. Ehrlich, author of the landmark book <i>The Population Bomb,</i> predicted that rising populations would cause overconsumption, resource scarcity, and famine&#x2014;with apocalyptic consequences for humanity. Simon optimistically countered that human welfare would flourish thanks to flexible markets, technological change, and our collective ingenuity.&nbsp;Simon and Ehrlich&#x2019;s debate reflected a deepening national conflict over the future of the planet. <i>The Bet</i> weaves the two men&#x2019;s lives and ideas together with the era&#x2019;s partisan political clashes over the environment and the role of government. In a lively narrative leading from the dawning environmentalism of the 1960s through the pivotal presidential contest between Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and on into the 1990s, Paul Sabin shows how the fight between Ehrlich and Simon&#x2014;between environmental fears and free-market confidence&#x2014;helped create the gulf separating environmentalists and their critics today. Drawing insights from both sides, Sabin argues for using social values, rather than economic or biological absolutes, to guide society&#x2019;s crucial choices relating to climate change, the planet&#x2019;s health, and our own.</p><p><b>Paul Sabin</b> is associate professor, Department of History, Yale University.

They stand out as one of the pinnacles in the critically neglected but perennially popular tradition of weird writing that includes E.T.A. Hoffmann and Charles Dickens as well as more recent masters like Jorge Luis Borges and Roald Dahl. With a cast of characters that ranges from man-eating flora to disgruntled devils and suburban salarymen (not that it&#39;s always easy to tell one from another), Collier&#39;s dazzling stories explore the implacable logic of lunacy, revealing a surreal landscape whose unstable surface is depth-charged with surprise.</p><p>John Collier (1901-1980) was born in London. He began his writing career as a poet, first publishing in 1920. He turned to fiction in the early 1930s, producing the popular and controversial novel,&nbsp;<i>His Monkey Wife</i>, about a man who is married to a chimpanzee. In 1935 Collier left England for Hollywood, where he became an active and prolific writer for film and later television; he was particularly influential in developing the brilliantly creepy and subversive style of such television classics as &#x201c;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Twilight Zone.&#x201d; An adaptation from Milton,&nbsp;<i>Paradise Lost: Screenplay for Cinema of the Mind</i>&nbsp;was published in 1973, but never produced as a film. Collier&#x2019;s other works range from the poetry collection&nbsp;<i>Gemini</i>&nbsp;(1931) to the novels&nbsp;<i>Tom&#x2019;s A-Cold</i>(1933) and&nbsp;<i>Defy the Foul Fiend</i>&nbsp;(1934), and the short story collections&nbsp;<i>Presenting Moonshine</i>&nbsp;(1941),&nbsp;<i>Fancies and Goodnights</i>&nbsp;(1951),&nbsp;<i>Pictures in the Fire</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;<i>The John Collier Reader</i>&nbsp;(1972), and&nbsp;<i>The Best of John Collier</i>&nbsp;(1975).<br><br>Ray Bradbury started writing fiction at the age of twelve and published his first story when he was twenty. He has since written more than thirty books&#x2014;novels, stories, essays, plays, and poems&#x2014;including&nbsp;<i>The Martian Chronicles&nbsp;</i>(1950), the futuristic novel&nbsp;<i>Fahrenheit 451&nbsp;</i>(1952), and a collection of short stories T<i>he Illustrated Man</i>&nbsp;(1951). He lives with his wife in Los Angeles.Intense like poems, compressed like epigrams, short stories have always inclined to the lyrical and biting. No story writer ever bit more sharply or wrote more gracefully than John Collier. When I first encountered his work, twenty-five years ago, I was shocked by his plots and delighted by his cruelty; now I take my delight in the dark silky stuff of his prose style, and the shock lies in his faultless execution and in his mastery of craft.

Arminian theology is sweeping through the evangelical churches of North America. While most Arminians are good, sincere, orthodox Christians, authors Robert A. Peterson and Michael D. Williams contend that aspects of Arminian thought are troubling both biblically and theologically. In particular, they argue, Arminians have too lofty a view of human nature and an inadequate understanding of God's sovereign love in Christ. <em>Why I Am Not an Arminian</em> explores the biblical, theological and historical background to the Calvinist-Arminian debate. The irenic nature and keen insight of this book will be appreciated by laypeople, pastors and scholars alike.</p><p>Robert A. Peterson (Ph.D., Drew University) is professor of systematic theology at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. He was formerly professor of New Testament and theology at Biblical Theological Seminary in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. His books include <em>Getting to Know John's Gospel: A Fresh Look at Its Main Ideas, Hell on Trial: The Case for Eternal Punishment, Calvin's Doctrine of the Atonement, Adopted by God: From Wayward Sinners to Cherished Children</em> (all Presbyterian Reformed) and <em>Hell Under Fire</em> (coedited with Chris Morgan, Zondervan). He has written numerous articles, was a contributor to the second edition of the <em>Evangelical Dictionary of Theology</em> (Baker) and edits Covenant Seminary's journal, <em>Presbyterion.</em>"A highly nuanced, theologically erudite work which presents Arminianism in the best possible light and then shifts the focus onto a positive construction of Calvinism to counter Arminian claims." (Myk Habets, Pacific Journal of Baptist Research)<br><br>"Very beneficial to those learning about Calvinism or Calvinists who are looking to reinforce their particular perspective. . .Very useful as a supplemental text for one studying theology. Pastors who have an interest in theology will appreciate the brevity of the book." (Larry Sterling, Jr., Ashland Theological Journal, 2008)<br><br>"Peterson and Williams write with a grace which goes far deeper than their commendable style. The authors' Arminian conversants are fairly represented from their best literature and answered with impeccable arguments which are scripturally compelling, philosophically and historically exacting, and gracefully irenic. <em>Why I Am Not an Arminian</em> is a book that you can get your head and your heart around--and be graced!" (R. Kent Hughes, Pastor, College Church in Wheaton, Wheaton, Illinois)<br><br>"Peterson and Williams have addressed the historic debate between Calvinism and Arminianism with an irenic spirit and a zeal for truth. This is Christian scholarship at its best, characterized by biblical rigor, philosophical acumen, charitable expression and a willingness to engage opponents only after giving them a fair hearing in their own words. Not only are opponents treated fairly, so are the Scriptures. Peterson and Williams refuse to push the Bible into a box of easy answers and formula defenses. There are aspects of God's sovereignty that will remain mystery until we are face to face with him. Peterson and Williams do not shy from the mystery but embrace it as an expression of the greatness of the God who makes us his own." (Bryan Chapell, President and Professor of Practical Theology, Covenant Theological Seminary)<br><br>"A quick glance at this volume's title might give someone the impression that the book is a harsh, polemical attack on Arminianism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Though clearly written from a Reformed evangelical perspective, <em>Why I Am Not an Arminian</em> is an evenhanded and careful critique of the Arminian approach to sin and salvation. To their credit, Robert Peterson and Mike Williams refuse to stack the theological deck in their favor by fairly evaluating only first-rate cases for Arminianism. After thoroughly addressing the historical context, theological concerns and biblical issues in a readable manner, Peterson and Williams show that even the best Arminian positions come up short. <em>Why I Am Not an Arminian</em> is a solid, valuable and biblically centered contribution to this never-ending discussion." (Chris Morgan, Associate Professor of Theology, California Baptist University)<br><br>"Those who have been unclear about the issues separating Calvinists and Arminians will find here a carefully reasoned, understandable exposition of Calvinist theology. The authors treat their dialogue partners fairly, even compassionately, asking hard questions while avoiding triumphalism or caricature. <em>Why I Am Not an Arminian</em> will be a genuine help to anyone wanting to better understand the nature and application of salvation in Christ." (Robert A. Pyne, Th.D., Professor of Systematic Theology, Dallas Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Peterson and Williams do not fall prey to a rant against Arminianism. Their work displays an irenicism and charity that serves as a model for other authors. Even Calvinists may disagree with some of their arguments, but at the end of the day Peterson and Williams demonstrate that Calvinism is biblically grounded and Arminianism is not. This book is ideal for those who wonder what the debate between Calvinists and Arminians is all about." (Thomas R. Schreiner, Professor of New Testament, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary)<br><br>"I can hardly say enough in praise of this book. It is not flashy, but it is attractive. It models both clarity and charity. It does not fixate on pet Bible verses but covers seminal discussions in church history. At the same time it is Bible-centered in its presentation; it does not simply rehearse partisan opinions. In a new millennium, the church is looking for new direction. I believe Peterson and Williams offer it with this corrective but positive exposition of the faith. They promote church unity, aid clear thinking and set forth divine teaching in constructive dialogue with human preference. Arminians, Calvinists and everyone in between are in the authors' debt."

He is also a highly respected artist whose works have been displayed throughout the world. He paints in the four colours his people (the Yorta Yorta) have used since the beginning of time: black from fire coals, white from pipe clay, red and yellow from ground ochre, and he mixes these with acrylic to achieve his own distinctive, contemporary effect.

Grade 2&#x2013;6&#x2014;With the help of Aboriginal storytellers who have collected the tales and myths of their people, Marshall has assembled 10 fascinating stories of the Dreamtime. Many explain why some things are the way they are: "How the Kangaroo got her Pouch," "Why Frogs can only Croak," and "How the Crocodile got its Scales." Others tell about the creation of the Earth, death, and other universal concerns. Each selection is beautifully told and is illustrated by a traditional artist who uses the distinctive symbols and colors of the Aboriginal people. An informational page follows each retelling, giving readers facts about the subject. Concluding pages offer a brief explanation of who the Aboriginal Australians are and an illustrated spread that explains the symbols and their meanings.

First published in 1613, it was the first work by a woman to be published under her real name. Never performed during Cary's lifetime, and apparently never intended for performance, the Senecan revenge tragedy tells the story of Mariam, the second wife of Herod. The play exposes and explores the themes of sex, divorce, betrayal, murder, and Jewish society under Herod's tyrannous rule. </p><p> The wide-ranging introduction discusses the play in the context of closet drama, female dramatists and feminist criticism, providing an ideal edition for study and teaching. This is a major edition of an unusual and provocative play not widely available elsewhere.</p></p><p>Karen Britland is Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.&#x201c;It's a probing, anxious play, and [editor] Britland points to parallels with Cary's own vexed domestic circumstances. She also sketches in the brief performance history: <i>Mariam</i> did not receive a full production until 1994.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Plays International</i></p><h2>One-Minute Apologist</h2><p><p>If you're looking for solid Catholic answers to common Protestant challenges, but don't have lots of time, then reach for <em>The One-Minute Apologist</em>.</p> <p>Here renowned Catholic apologist Dave Armstrong (author of <em>A Biblical Defense of Catholicism</em> and <em>The Catholic Verses</em>) has assembled over sixty of the claims and arguments that Protestants (of all stripes) most frequently level against the Church. Drawing on a lifetime of study in Scripture, history, and the works of Catholic and Protestant theologians he delivers the essential Catholic replies to each claim, packaged for you in a compact and uniquely usable format.</p> <p>And since he's a convert from Evangelicalism, Armstrong presents these anti-Catholic claims with an insider's accuracy using the special terms, references, and follow-up arguments that you're mostly likely to hear in real-world encounters and responds to them in a way Protestants can understand and appreciate.</p> <p><em>The One-Minute Apologist</em> is concise, but never superficial. It cites or quotes more than a thousand Scripture verses, along with the words of scores of saints and scholars including many respected Protestant sources. Packing centuries of learning and wisdom into just a few tightly structured pages, <em>The One-Minute Apologist</em> decisively refutes common Protestant claims such as:</p> <li> The Bible is the only infallible source of theological truth. </li><li> Peter is not the rock to which Jesus referred. </li><li> Celibacy for priests is unnatural and unbiblical. </li><li> The Catholic Mass is an abomination. </li><li> True Christians cannot fall away from salvation. </li><li> Mary had other children besides Jesus. </li><li> Indulgences allow Catholics to indulge in sin. </li><li> Venerating the saints is a form of idolatry. </li><li> The Catholic ban on contraception has no scriptural basis. </li><li>And over 50 other pervasive Protestant objections to Catholic doctrine and practice! <br><br> <p>More accessible than thick theological tomes, more substantial than tracts, and better organized than other quick answer books, <em>The One-Minute Apologist</em> is the one source you ll find yourself turning to whenever you have the need to defend the Catholic Faith quickly, credibly, and well.</p></li></p><p>Dave Armstrong is a Catholic apologist and author (convert from evangelical Protestantism in 1991).

Don't miss the newest, &nbsp;<i><b>Miss Julia Raises the Roof</b></i>, coming April 2018 from Viking.&nbsp;</b><br><br> Miss Julia's iron will and kind heart have assured her a spot among the most beloved characters of Southern literature. In her latest adventure, Miss Julia whisks Hazel Marie off to the doctor when the latter admits she's been feeling poorly. The news floors them both: Hazel Marie is pregnant with twins. Unfortunately, she's also just sent her beau, Mr. Pickens, packing. Miss Julia needs a plan-and fast. So when Sam's house is robbed, Miss Julia declares that only J. D. Pickins, P.I., can get his things back. Playing Cupid and solving the crime might seem like a tall order but readers everywhere know that Miss Julia <i>always</i> delivers the goods.</p><p><p><b><b>Ann B.

She lives in Hendersonville, North Carolina.</p>An unplanned pregnancy, a destructive break-in and a nasty gazpacho incident are just a few of the problems facing Julia Murdoch in Ross's diverting 10th cozy to feature the North Carolina matron (after 2008's <i>Miss Julia Paints the Town</i>). When na�ve Hazel Marie, the former mistress of Miss Julia's first husband, learns that her flulike symptoms have another cause, it's up to the enterprising Miss Julia to patch things up between Hazel Marie and her estranged PI boyfriend, J.D. Pickens. Meanwhile, a burglary at the house of lawyer Sam Murdoch, Miss Julia's second husband, means trouble. The disappearance of Sam's meticulous files on local court cases suggests there are parties who don't want information on Abbot County's philandering judge and corrupt sheriff to see the light of day. Those who prefer a leisurely pace, a touch of screwball comedy and gentle puzzles in their mysteries will enjoy this paean to smalltown nosiness and steadfast loyalties. <i>6-city author tour.

He lives in the Dordogne and Washington, DC.1<br><br>As if determined to make it his last sight on earth, the dead man clutched what at first appeared to be a small painting on canvas or parchment. Bruno moved closer and saw that it was no painting but rather a large and beautiful banknote, nearly twice the size of the undistinguished but familiar euro notes in his wallet.<br><br>Impeccably engraved in pastel hues stood Mercury with his winged heels before a port teeming with sailing vessels and steamships. Facing him was a bare-chested Vulcan with his forge against a backdrop of a modern factory with tall chimneys belching smoke. It was a Banque de France note for one thousand francs of a kind that Bruno had never seen before. On the quilted coverlet that was tucked up tightly to the corpse&#x2019;s grizzled chin lay another banknote, of the same style and value. Picking it up, Bruno was startled by its texture, still thick and crinkly as if made more of linen than paper. It was the reverse side of the same kind of note the dead man held. Against a cornucopia of fruits and flowers, a proud cockerel and sheaves of wheat, two medallions contained the profiles of a Greek god and goddess. They stared impassively at each other against the engraved signatures of some long-dead bank officials, and above them was printed the date of issue: december 1940.<br><br>His eyebrows rose. For any Frenchman 1940 was a solemn year. It marked the third German invasion in seventy years and the second French defeat. But it was the first time Paris had fallen to German arms. In 1870, the capital had withstood months of siege before French troops, under the watchful eye of the kaiser&#x2019;s armies, stormed the capital to defeat and slaughter the revolutionaries of the Paris Commune. The Germans who invaded in 1914 were eventually defeated. But in 1940, France had surrendered and signed a humiliating armistice. German soldiers had marched through the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs-�lys�es and launched an occupation that would last for more than four years. France under Marshal P�tain&#x2019;s Vichy regime had retained some shred of sovereignty over a truncated half of the country, while the Germans took over Paris, the north and the whole Atlantic coastline. So it was a Vichy banknote Bruno held in his hands, and he wondered how long after the war&#x2019;s end it had remained legal tender.<br><br>There were more notes, for varying amounts, inside a black wooden box that lay open at the dead man&#x2019;s side. Alongside them were some old photographs. The one on top showed a group of young men and boys carrying shotguns, revolvers and elderly submachine guns. They were grouped around a black Citro�n Traction Avant, one of the most handsome cars France ever made. A French tricolore flag was draped across the hood.<br><br>Bruno picked up the photo and turned it over to see the scrawled words Groupe Valmy, 3 juillet, 1944. Most of the individuals were dressed like farmers, some wore berets, and two had the old steel helmets from the 1914&#x2013;�1918 war. An older man sported a French officer&#x2019;s uniform with leather straps across his chest and ammunition pouches. He held up a grenade in each hand. Each of the men had an armband with the letters ffi. Bruno knew it stood for Forces Fran�aises de l&#x2019;Int�rieur, the name de Gaulle had chosen for the Resistance fighters. Another photo showed the same car and an ancient truck parked beside a train. The doors of a freight car were open, and men in a human chain were passing sacks from the train to the truck. On the back of the photo were the words Neuvic, 26 juillet, 1944.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been allowed to see inside his box before,&#x201d; said the woman Father Sentout had introduced as Jos�phine, one of the dead man&#x2019;s three daughters. She eyed the photos but made no move to touch them or the banknotes. Her hands, work worn and gnarled, remained clenched in her lap. She looked to be in her sixties. The priest was packing away the breviary and holy oils he had used to give the last rites. Spots of oil gleamed on the dead man&#x2019;s forehead, where the priest had made the last sign of the cross, and on his eyelids.<br><br>&#x201c;Eighty-six,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;A good age, a long life and he served France. Your father is with our Father in heaven now.&#x201d; He put his hand gently on the woman&#x2019;s arm. She shook it off.<br><br>&#x201c;We could have done with that money when I was growing up,&#x201d; she said, staring dry eyed at the banknotes. &#x201c;They were hard times.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was the banknotes that made me call you,&#x201d; said Father Sentout, turning to Bruno. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the law says about them, being out of date.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re part of his estate, so they&#x2019;ll go to his heirs,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;But those photos mean I&#x2019;ll probably have to plan for a special funeral.&#x201d; He turned to Jos�phine. &#x201c;Do you know if he had the Resistance medal?&#x201d;<br><br>She gestured with her head to a small picture frame on the wall above the bed, below a crucifix. Bruno leaned across the bed to look closer. The curtains were open, and the sun was shining, but only a modest light came from the tiny courtyard. He saw the stone wall of a neighbor&#x2019;s house barely six feet away. A single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling in a dingy parchment lampshade did little to help, but he could make out the small brass circle with its engraved Cross of Lorraine hanging from a black-and-crimson ribbon. Beneath it in the frame was a faded FFI armband and a photograph of a young Murcoing wearing it and holding a rifle.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to check the official list but it looks like he qualifies for a Resistance funeral with a guard of honor and a flag for the coffin,&#x201d; Bruno said. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you want, I&#x2019;ll make the arrangements. The state pays for it all. You can either have him buried at the big Resistance cemetery at Chasseneuil or here in St. Denis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was wondering if he&#x2019;d left enough to pay for cremation,&#x201d; she said, looking around the small bedroom with its faded floral wallpaper and a cheap wardrobe that had seen better days. &#x201c;He was waiting for a place in the retirement home, so the mairie stuck him in here.&#x201d;<br><br>The old man had lived alone in the small apartment formed from the ground floor of a narrow three-story house in one of the backstreets of St. Denis. Bruno remembered when the mairie had bought the building and converted it for social housing. Four families were stuffed into the upstairs apartments, and another from the waiting list would be moved into this place as soon as the old man was removed. The recession had been hard on St. Denis.<br><br>&#x201c;Paul should be here by now,&#x201d; she said, looking at her watch. &#x201c;His grandson, my sister&#x2019;s boy. I called him as soon as I called the priest. He&#x2019;s the only one my dad ever had much time for, the only other man in the family.&#x201d; She looked sourly at the corpse in the bed. &#x201c;Three daughters weren&#x2019;t enough for him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your phone number to let you know about the funeral,&#x201d; Bruno said, taking out his notebook. &#x201c;Do you know where he kept his papers, if there&#x2019;s a will?&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugged and gave her number. &#x201c;Nothing much to leave.&#x201d; She looked at her watch again. &#x201c;I have to go. I&#x2019;ll take whatever food he&#x2019;s left.&#x201d; Through the open door they heard her rummaging in the small fridge and the food cupboard before she stomped down the narrow passage beside the garage that led to the street.<br><br>&#x201c;Not much sign of grief there,&#x201d; said Bruno, taking out his phone to call the medical center. A doctor would have to certify death before Murcoing could be taken to the funeral parlor.<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have many visits from his family, except for Paul,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;All the sisters live in Bergerac. Jos�phine told me she works as a night nurse, so she probably sees more than enough of the old and sick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How sick was he? I haven&#x2019;t seen him in the caf� for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He knew he was dying, and he didn&#x2019;t seem to mind,&#x201d; Father Sentout replied. &#x201c;He had pneumonia but refused to go to the hospital. That was the sickness we used to call the old man&#x2019;s friend. It&#x2019;s a peaceful passing, they just slip away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember seeing him coming out of church. Was he a regular?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His wife dragged him along. After she died he didn&#x2019;t come so often at first, but this place is close to the church so he&#x2019;d come along for Mass, for the company as much as anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did he ever talk about the money?&#x201d; Bruno gestured at the open box on the bed and the banknote still held tightly in Murcoing&#x2019;s dead hands.<br><br>The priest paused, as if weighing his words in a way that made Bruno wonder whether there was some secret of the confessional that was being kept back.<br><br>&#x201c;Not directly, but he&#x2019;d rail against the fat cats and the rich and complained of being cheated. It was just ramblings. I was never clear whether he thought his daughters had cheated him out of the money from the farm or if it was something else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there something you can&#x2019;t tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>Father Sentout shrugged. &#x201c;Nothing directly linked to the money. I presume it&#x2019;s from the Neuvic train. You know about that, right? The great train robbery by the Resistance?&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno shook his head. He&#x2019;d heard of it but not the details. These days, the priest explained, the story was more legend than anything else. A vast sum of money, said to be hundreds of millions, had been stolen from a train taking reserves from the Banque de France to the German naval garrison in Bordeaux. Despite various official inquiries, large amounts had never been accounted for, and local tradition had it that several Resistance leaders had bought grand homes, started businesses and financed political careers after the war with the loot.<br><br>&#x201c;If that was his share, he didn&#x2019;t get much,&#x201d; Father Sentout concluded, nodding at the banknotes on the bed. After the war there had been so many devaluations. Then in 1960 came de Gaulle&#x2019;s currency reform; a new franc was launched, each worth a hundred of the old ones. &#x201c;That thousand-franc banknote is probably worth less than a euro, if it&#x2019;s worth anything at all.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno bent down to pry the note from the cold fingers. As he put it inside the box with the photographs, he heard footsteps in the corridor, and Fabiola bustled into the small room, her medical bag in tow. She was wearing a long white coat of freshly pressed cotton, and her dark hair was piled loosely atop her head. An intriguing scent came with her, a curious blend of antiseptic and perfume, overwhelming the stale air of the room. She kissed Bruno on both cheeks and shook hands with Father Sentout, pulling out her stethoscope to examine the body.<br><br>&#x201c;He obviously didn&#x2019;t take his medicine. Sometimes I wonder why we bother,&#x201d; she said, sorting through the small array of plastic jars from the pharmacy that stood by the bed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead, and there&#x2019;s nothing suspicious. I&#x2019;ll leave the certificate at the front desk of the clinic so you can pick it up. Meanwhile we&#x2019;d better get him to the funeral home.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped at the door and faced Bruno. &#x201c;Is this going to stop you from getting to the airport? I&#x2019;ll be free by five so I can do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It should be okay. If there&#x2019;s a problem, I&#x2019;ll call you,&#x201d; he replied. Pamela, the Englishwoman Bruno had been seeing since the previous autumn, was to land at the local airport of Bergerac just before six that evening, and he was to meet her and drive her back to St. Denis. Pamela, who kept horses along with the g�tes she rented out to tourists, had been pleased to find in Fabiola a year-round tenant for one of the g�tes, and the two women had become friends.<br><br>Bruno began making calls as soon as Fabiola and the priest left. He started with the veterans&#x2019; department at the Ministry of Defense to confirm a Resistance ceremony and then called the funeral parlor. Next he rang Florence, the science teacher at the local coll�ge who was now running the town choir, to ask if she could arrange for the &#x201c;Chant des Partisans,&#x201d; the anthem of the Resistance, to be sung at the funeral. He rang the Centre Jean Moulin in Bordeaux, the Resistance museum and archive, for its help in preparing a summary of Mur�coing&#x2019;s war record. The last call was to the social security office, to stop the dead man&#x2019;s pension payments. As he waited to be put through to the right department, he looked around the apartment.<br><br>In the sitting room an old TV squatted on a chest of drawers. In the top drawer, he found a large envelope marked Banque and others that contained various utility bills and a copy of the bill of sale for Murcoing&#x2019;s farm in the hills above Limeuil. It had been sold three years earlier, when prices were already tumbling, for eighty-five thousand euros. The buyer had a name that sounded Dutch, and the notaire was local. Bruno remembered the place, a ramshackle farmhouse with a roof that needed fixing and an old tobacco barn where goats were kept. The farm had been too small to be viable, even if the land had been good. Murcoing&#x2019;s last bank statement said he had six thousand euros in a Livret, a tax-free account set up by the state to encourage saving, and just over eight hundred in his checking account. He&#x2019;d been getting a pension of four hundred euros a month. There was no phone and no address book. A dusty shotgun hung on the wall, and a fishing rod, its handle worn with years of use, stood in the corner. The house key hung on a hook beside the door. Bruno thought old Murcoing did not have much to show for a life of hard work and patriotism.<br><br>He wrote out a receipt for the gun, the box and its contents and left it in the top drawer. Beside the TV set he saw a well-used wallet. Inside were a carte d&#x2019;identit� and the carte vitale that gave access to the health service, but no credit cards and no cash. Jos�phine would have seen to that. There were three small photos, one a portrait of a handsome young man and two more with the same young man with an arm around the shoulders of the elderly Murcoing at what looked like a family gathering. That must be Paul, the favorite grandson, who was supposed to arrive. Bruno left a note for him on the table, along with his business card and mobile number, asking Paul to get in touch about the funeral and saying he&#x2019;d taken the gun, the box and banknotes to his office in the mairie for safekeeping.<br><br>As the hearse was arriving, Bruno&#x2019;s mobile phone rang, and a sultry voice said, &#x201c;I have something for you.&#x201d; The mayor&#x2019;s secretary was incapable of saying even bonjour without some hint of coquetry. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a message from some foreigner&#x2019;s cleaning woman on the road out to Rouffignac. She thinks there&#x2019;s been a burglary.&#x201d;</p><h2>Vasily Grossman and the Soviet Century</h2><p><b>The definitive biography of Soviet Jewish dissident writer Vasily Grossman</b><br> &nbsp;<br> If Vasily Grossman&#x2019;s 1961 masterpiece, <i>Life and Fate</i>, had been published during his lifetime, it would have reached the world together with Pasternak&#x2019;s <i>Doctor Zhivago</i> and before Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s <i>Gulag</i>. But <i>Life and Fate</i> was seized by the KGB. When it emerged posthumously, decades later, it was recognized as the <i>War and Peace</i> of the twentieth century. Always at the epicenter of events, Grossman (1905&#x2013;1964) was among the first to describe the Holocaust and the Ukrainian famine. His 1944 article &#x201c;The Hell of Treblinka&#x201d; became evidence at Nuremberg. Grossman&#x2019;s powerful anti-totalitarian works liken the Nazis&#x2019; crimes against humanity with those of Stalin. His compassionate prose has the everlasting quality of great art.

The largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history will soon be under way, bringing with it the potential for huge increases in philanthropic funding. <i>Engine of Impact</i> shows how nonprofits can apply the principles of strategic leadership to attract greater financial support and leverage that funding to maximum effect.</p> <p>As <i>Good to Great</i> author Jim Collins writes in his foreword, this book offers "a detailed roadmap of disciplined thought and action for turning a good nonprofit into one that can achieve great impact at scale."</p> <p>William F. Meehan III and Kim Starkey Jonker identify seven essential components of strategic leadership that set high-achieving organizations apart from the rest of the nonprofit sector. Together, these components form an "engine of impact"&#x2015;a system that organizations must build, tune, and fuel if they hope to make a real difference in the world.</p> <p>Drawing on decades of teaching, advising, grantmaking, and research, Meehan and Jonker provide an actionable guide that executives, staff, board members, and donors can use to jumpstart their own performance and to achieve extraordinary results for their organization. Along with setting forth best practices using real-world examples, the authors outline common management challenges faced by nonprofits, showing how these challenges differ from those faced by for-profit businesses in important and often-overlooked ways.</p> <p>By offering crucial insights on the fundamentals of nonprofit management, this book will help leaders equip their organizations to fire on all cylinders and unleash the full potential of the nonprofit sector.

Focusing specifically on the hatha tradition, the book delves deep into original Sanskrit texts, explaining the theoretical foundation of yoga in clear, encouraging language. Remete describes the "shadows" noted by classical yoga teachers that block the student, and shows ways to move beyond them. The book covers the key concepts of traditional yoga&#x2014;the <i>marmas, </i>chakras, <i>vayus </i>(sources of energy), and <i>nadis </i>(flows of energy through the body)&#x2014;before turning to the yogic techniques that improve their condition and functioning&#x2014;asana (poses), <i>nauli </i>(abdominal exercises), pranayama (breathing), mudra (gestures), and <i>laya</i> (absorptions). It closes with illustrated sequences of the most important asanas. <i>Shadow Yoga </i>also discusses various little-understood, oft-neglected aspects of yogic training, such as the role of <i>marma </i>points (acupuncture-like energy points) and the influence of the zodiac. Detailed drawings of the body&#x2019;s energy system and its links to these elemental and planetary forces provide a visual guide to these largely unknown areas of yoga. This knowledge, considered essential in Indian yogic traditions, has been almost entirely lost in modern Western schools of yoga. Author Remete restores that information in this beautifully designed book.</p></p><p>Shandor Remete, also known by his teaching name of Natanaga Zhander, is the founder of Shadow Yoga, a form of yoga that addresses all aspects of self-cultivation. He was born in 1948 into a Hungarian household in Novi Knezevac, Yugoslavia, and has been practicing hatha yoga since the age of six, when his father introduced him to the practice.His research background also includes the study of the application of <i>varma kalai,</i> or <i>marma sthana</i>, an ancient Dravidian martial and healing art, and the Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine. There are Shadow Yoga courses and workshops in Western Europe, Russia, Asia, the United States, and Australia.www.shadowyoga.com"This invaluable book introduces the reading public to the full scope of the practice of genuine hatha yoga. Full of hints that veteran practitioners can follow to revolutionize their practices, it should be read by every serious student of yoga."<br> &#x2014;Dr. Robert Svoboda, author of <i>Ayurveda: Life, Health, and Longevity </i>and <i>Light on Life: An Introduction to the Astrology of India<br> </i></p><h2>A Murderous Procession (Mistress of the Art of Death)</h2><p><b>Tess Garritsen calls this one "my favorite book of the year!" </b><br><br> In 1176, King Henry II sends his daughter Joanna to Palermo to marry his cousin, the king of Sicily. Henry chooses Adelia Aguilar to travel with the princess and safeguard her health. But when people in the wedding procession are murdered, Adelia and Rowley must discover the killer's identity, and whether he is stalking the princess or Adelia herself.</p><p>Ariana Franklin is the pen name of British writer Diana Norman. A bestselling author and former journalist, she lives in England with her husband, the film critic Barry Norman.In the fourth Mistress of the Art of Death mystery, medieval forensic pathologist Adelia Aguilar has been an enjoying a quiet life in the countryside with her daughter and friends. Then Henry II demands that she accompany his daughter and her formal procession to Italy and offers to &#x201c;keep&#x201d; her daughter with Queen Eleanor until her safe return. But death stalks the procession, and Adelia and her loyal friends soon realize that the killer is someone from her past bent on revenge. As with previous books in the series, historical details are many and add an extra layer of atmosphere. Readers who doubt the likelihood of a female Jewish pathologist in twelfth-century Britain will be reassured by Franklin&#x2019;s detailed historical notes at the end of the book. With some uneven pacing and a plot that relies heavily on previous series knowledge, this book isn&#x2019;t the best place to start for readers new to the series, but it will be enjoyed by series fans. --Jessica Moyer</p><h2>Batman: Detective Comics Vol. 8: On the Outside</h2><p><b>The greatest superhero team in Gotham City history is gone... this time, for good.

Mair teams up with journalist Erling Hoh to tell the story of this remarkable beverage and its uses, from ancient times to the present, from East to West.<br><br> For the first time in a popular history of tea, the Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan, and Mongolian annals have been thoroughly consulted and carefully sifted. The resulting narrative takes the reader from the jungles of Southeast Asia to the splendor of the Tang and Song Dynasties, from the tea ceremony politics of medieval Japan to the fabled tea and horse trade of Central Asia and the arrival of the first European vessels in Far Eastern waters.<br><br> Through the centuries, tea has inspired artists, enhanced religious experience, played a pivotal role in the emergence of world trade, and triggered cataclysmic events that altered the course of humankind. How did green tea become the national beverage of Morocco? And who was the beautiful Emma Hart, immortalized by George Romney in his painting <em>The Tea-maker of Edgware Road</em>? No other drink has touched the daily lives of so many people in so many different ways.<br><br><em>The True History of Tea</em> brings these disparate aspects together in an entertaining tale that combines solid scholarship with an eye for the quirky, offbeat paths that tea has strayed upon during its long voyage. It celebrates the common heritage of a beverage we have all come to love, and plays a crucial part in the work of dismantling that obsolete dictum: East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet. 50 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Erling Hoh</strong> has been a correspondent for Archaeology and written on Chinese history and culture for Natural History and others.<br></p><p><strong>Victor H.

That is the alarming conclusion by intelligence analyst Daryl Johnson, an expert on domestic extremism with more than twenty-five years of experience tracking radicalized groups for the US government. In this book, Johnson dissects the rapidly expanding forms of American hatred and radicalization, including white nationalists, antigovernment militias, antifascists (Antifa), militant black nationalists, and extremist Islamic groups. The author develops a concise model that explains how extremists on both the far right and the far left use the same techniques to recruit and to radicalize individuals, turning them into violent offenders. He also examines the political forces that fuel this threat and have kept the US government from properly identifying and developing countermeasures to deal with it, including a disproportional emphasis on Islamic terrorism.Johnson concludes by recounting individual stories of deradicalization, each of which was the result of personal reevaluations of formerly held extremist convictions. He recommends more resources at the state and federal levels for combatting radical movements and urges greater communication and coordination between law enforcement agencies. This in-depth analysis of a growing menace that has taken America hostage throws a stark light on the darkest segments of American society and provides practical means for dealing with their violent threats.</p><p><b>Daryl Johnson</b> is one of the foremost experts on domestic extremist groups in the United States. Beginning his career as a civilian in the US Army, Johnson has held a number of government positions, most recently as a senior analyst at the Department of Homeland Security. He works at a private consulting firm for law enforcement, DT Analytics, which he founded. He is also regularly cited, featured, or quoted in media covering domestic extremist groups in the United States, including the <i>New York Times</i>,<i> Washington Post</i>,<i> Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Newsweek, </i>NPR, MSNBC, CNN, and <i>NBC Nightly News</i>, among many others. He is the author of <i>Right-Wing Resurgence: How a Domestic Terrorism Threat Is Being Ignored</i>. In 2012, he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on hate crimes and the threat of domestic extremism. Born in Warrenton, Virginia, he lives in Martinsburg, West Virginia.Introduction - The Secret Extremists<br><br>On July 7, 2016, a twenty-five-year-old African American man with a neatly trimmed beard called out to his mom, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going into Dallas. There&#x2019;s a march tonight.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What kind of march?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Two days ago the cops shot a black man down in Louisiana. They killed another one yesterday up in Minneapolis. They got it on video. Mom &#x2014; you gotta watch the news.&#x201d;<br><br>Just stay out of trouble, baby.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d;<br><br>With that, Micah Johnson walked out the front door of the suburban house in Mesquite, Texas, where he was raised and still lived with his mother, Delphine, and his younger sister. Johnson worked from home as well, providing care to his learning-disabled younger brother through a local social services agency. He played basketball at the school down the street and was described by his neighborhood friends as &#x201c;chill.&#x201d; He had no criminal record and was not a member of any violent groups.<br><br>To the casual observer, there was little that set Johnson apart &#x2014; politically or otherwise &#x2014; from tens of thousands of other young African American men. And there was certainly no reason for Delphine to suspect that this was the last conversation she would have with her son.<br><br>Johnson headed into Dallas, driving west on I-30, and parked his Chevy SUV on Lamar Street, a block from Dealey Plaza, where John Kennedy was assassinated. By 8:58 pm, as the peaceful march was winding down, he had dressed in tactical gear, armed himself with a Saiga AK-47 and a Glock 19 handgun, and begun firing at police.<br><br>After the shooting, an army buddy of Johnson&#x2019;s said, &#x201c;I loved him to death, but that guy was not really a good soldier.&#x201d; But the veteran had been training hard recently to make up for his deficiencies. While attacking the cops, he used advanced tactics, shooting and moving, luring officers in one direction with gunfire, then flanking them on the opposite side. By the time the police cornered him on the second floor of a community college, Johnson had killed five of them and wounded another nine.<br><br>During negotiations, Johnson taunted the cops, sang and laughed. Eventually, the police decided to deliver a bomb to Johnson with a mobile robotic unit that was normally used to dispose of explosives. As soon as the robot rolled into the area where Johnson had holed up, the bomb detonated, killing him instantly.<br><br>Johnson&#x2019;s mass shooting and suicide was a tragedy. But it was also an odd sort of murder mystery: The perpetrator was easily caught, but no one recognized him as the person who committed those hateful crimes. Micah Johnson&#x2019;s friends, family, and acquaintances were left with a burning question: What possessed this sensitive young man to go down such a dark antisocial path?<br><br>It turned out this was not an isolated case. Something similar had happened in a suburb of Chattannooga, Tennessee almost exactly a year earlier. Tall, friendly, handsome and athletic, twenty-four-year-old Muhammad Abdulazeez had been a champion wrestler and a good student at Red Bank High School. He&#x2019;d gone on to earn an engineering degree from the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga and worked at a company that made cabling for the telecommunications industries. He lived at his parents&#x2019; home in Colonial Shores, a suburb with large, well-tended yards, where his neighbors knew him as polite. Like Johnson, Abdulazeez had no criminal record and didn&#x2019;t belong to gangs or other violent groups.<br><br>Outside of work, his interests were unremarkable for a male in his twenties: fast cars, mixed martial arts, and guns. Abdulazeez joked that he was a &#x201c;Muslim Redneck.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d taught his friend James Petty how to shoot an AR-15 in the Tennessee woods, but lots of Americans owned assault rifles.<br><br>Like many other people in their twenties, Abdulazeez sometimes partied too hard. On the morning of July 16, 2015, he woke up with a horrible hangover and lay in bed, texting back and forth with a friend while he nursed his headache. Then, around ten that morning, he walked out to his rented Ford Mustang, tore out of Colonial Shores and across the Tennessee River towards central Chattanooga.<br><br>Ten minutes later, Abdulazeez turned into the parking lot of a strip mall and pulled up outside a U.S. Army recruiting station next to a Cricket Wireless store. Armed with an AK-47, a Saiga 12 shotgun, and a 9mm handgun, Abdulazeez fired a few dozen rounds at the station but didn&#x2019;t kill anyone. Just before the police arrived, he sped off to a nearby U.S. Navy Reserve center, rammed through the security gate, and jumped out with his weapons. He sprayed bullets as he charged through a reception building and out into the parking lot, killing five people. When Abdulazeez ran back into the building, he was fatally shot by police.<br><br>The incident was eerily similar to Johnson&#x2019;s. A seemingly normal middle-class young man drove out of his suburban neighborhood for the last time, armed with a cache of military-grade weapons and determined to kill as many of a specific group of people as possible. Back in Colonial Shores, the reaction to Muhammad Abdulazeez&#x2019;s mass shooting was also the same as Johnson&#x2019;s: Nobody saw it coming.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t stop there, though. There had been another such incident in South Carolina just a month earlier. On the morning of June 17, 2015, a black sedan drove on the backroads outside of Columbia, South Carolina headed for the local swimming hole. Inside, twenty-one-year-old Joe Meek, his girlfriend, Lindsey, and little brother, Jacob, were already in their swimsuits, ready to escape the humid air by jumping into Lake Murray. At the wheel was Joe&#x2019;s old middle-school friend, Dylann Roof, who had recently gotten back in touch via Facebook. Sometimes Roof stayed with the three of them in Meek&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s trailer, set back in the woods off Platt Springs Road.<br><br>In the back, Jacob Meek dropped his Big Gulp, spilling ice on Roof &#x2019;s black backpack.<br><br>&#x201c;Watch it!&#x201d; yelled Roof. &#x201c;There are magazines in there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Pornos?&#x201d; joked Meek, as he brushed the ice off.<br><br>&#x201c;No, man. Not pornos.&#x201d;<br><br>They pulled up at the lake a few minutes later, and everyone except the driver hopped out.<br><br>Roof told them he was going to check out <i>Jurassic World</i>. He was a ravenous consumer of movies, including <i>Titanic</i>, which he&#x2019;d watched repeatedly. Roof was also studious, spending a lot of time writing and online at the library. Again, he had no known affilliations with violent groups. Roof said that he would meet up with his friends again back at Joe&#x2019;s mom&#x2019;s trailer unless he went to his own mom&#x2019;s house.<br><br>At 8:00 pm, surveillance cameras showed Roof walking into an African-American church in central Charleston, South Carolina, about two hours from Columbia. For about 45 minutes, he sat down in a Bible study circle with a dozen parishioners. As everyone joined hands together and closed their eyes to pray, Roof pulled out a Glock .45 caliber handgun from his fanny pack and began methodically shooting the other people in the room while yelling racial epithets. He stood over some of the fallen victims, shooting them repeatedly as they helplessly lay on the floor. After killing nine people, Roof tried to shoot himself in the head, but realized he was out of ammo and fled the scene.<br><br>In the space of thirteen months, three relatively normal young men had killed a total of nineteen people. They hadn&#x2019;t known their victims, or stolen anything. There were neither precipitating arguments nor evidence of gang affiliation or drug use. They didn&#x2019;t fit the profile of serial killers. And, in each case, the family and friends were at a loss to explain why they had committed their crime. What was causing this epidemic?<br><br>The official answer was to label the young men &#x201c;violent extremists&#x201d;. But this answer created more questions. For example, if extremists are, by definition, outside the borders of mainstream society, how do we explain Abdulazeez&#x2019;s wrestling coach describing him as &#x201c;All American&#x201d; and &#x201c;one of the nicest kids we trained&#x201d;? Or his friend saying he was &#x201c;very positive about people&#x201d;? Or his neighbors, in what the<i> New York Times</i> called his &#x201c;movie-set version of American suburbia&#x201d;, remembering him as a friendly young man who jumped into front-yard wiffle ball games? This was an extremist? He sounded more like a double agent.<br><br>Johnson had perpetrated the deadliest terror attack on police since 9/11. But how did his hatred of law enforcement square with the young man who had joined the Junior ROTC in high school, hoping one day to serve his country? Or with the fact that he had been vocal about his mainstream Christian faith while stationed in Afghanistan? How does Johnson, being described by an army friend as &#x201c;goofy&#x201d; or his mother&#x2019;s claiming he was so sensitive that he got upset when their car hit a squirrel, fit into the profile of an extremist who gunned down five cops? In what way did his apparently racially-motivated violence intersect with the young man who went next door to buy Girl Scout cookies from his white neighbors? The descriptions of Johnson by the people who knew him best did not square with someone on the fringes of American society.<br><br>Roof &#x2019;s attack was racially-motivated but, to the people who knew him best, little had suggested that such a violent turn was imminent. He had grown up with black and biracial classmates, some of whom came over for middle school sleepovers. At the time of his shooting, a surprisingly large percentage of Roof&#x2019;s Facebook friends were African-American. Roof had reportedly expressed admiration for Rev. Martin Luther King after watching a documentary on him. Both his mother and father claim they raised him to respect all people and that he&#x2019;d never showed any aversion to being around people of other races. In a note written the day of the shooting, Roof himself wrote that &#x201c;I was not raised in a racist home or environment.&#x201d;<br><br>Most confounding, just a week before the shooting, Roof and his friend Joe had invited over Joe&#x2019;s African-American neighbor, Christon Scrivin, to party with pot, cocaine and cheap vodka. Scrivin later claimed that Roof &#x201c;never said anything racist, never treated me any different&#x201d; adding that Roof &#x201c;had no intention of harming those people in that church.&#x201d;<br><br>It was undeniable that the men had committed acts of extreme violence. But, up to that point, they had flown under the radar, well inside the boundaries of mainstream America. Were they a new breed of extremist Manchurian candidate? And what was meant by extremism, at any rate?</p><h2>The World&#39;s Greatest Submarines: An Illustrated History</h2><p>In 1776, American Patriots attempted to destroy the British flagship <i>Eagle</i> using a man-operated semi-submersible, the Turtle, in New York harbour. The attack failed, but the idea stuck. Almost 90 years later, the CSS Hunley successfully&nbsp; rammed into the Federal sloop USS Housatonic with a spar torpedo. The Housatonic became the first ship in naval history to be sunk by a submarine. <i>The World&#x2019;s Greatest Submarines</i> features the most significant submarines built, from the German U-9 &#x2013; which sank three British cruisers on 22 September 1914 &#x2013; through the huge Japanese I-400 class to the great nuclear-powered submarines of the Cold War, such as the USS Los Angeles and Soviet Oscar class. Also included are the &#x2018;undersea cruiser&#x2019; Surcouf; the highly successful Type VII U-boats of World War II; and the latest attack and ballistic missile submarines, such as HMS Astute, USS Virginia, the Chinese Type 094 and the Russian Yasen class.

This means that someone who is genetically destined to die at age 100 may not live past age 60 because of poor habits and lifestyle choices that cause accelerated aging and premature death. Conversely, a person can live to 100 and be functionally healthy.<br> <br>In this highly anticipated follow-up, Diana Schwarzbein, M.D., goes beyond the diet she introduced in her first book&#x2014;which literally helped thousands of people lose weight&#x2014;and offers a personalized anti-aging program for readers to heal their metabolisms and stop advanced aging in its tracks. <br> <br>Weaving in groundbreaking research and provocative case studies&#x2014;including her own regeneration and that of her clients&#x2014;she leads readers through a series of eye-opening questionnaires, which identify where they are on their path to either accelerated or healthy aging. <br> <br>Based on readers&#x2019; answers, she leads them to the &#x201c;how-to&#x201d; sections, which explain, in easy-to-follow and personalized detail, the steps they need to take to restore healthy functioning.

The transition is a journey of healing. You can only <i>be</i> in your transition if you are improving your nutrition and lifestyle habits.</p> <p>During your transition your hormones will change in response to the nutrition and lifestyle changes you make, and this allows you to heal. However, you will not have balanced hormones immediately-balanced hormones do not occur overnight. There are sequential steps of healing that everyone must take. </p> <p>When you initiate your transition process by improving your habits, your body will begin to rebalance its hormones. Your body will also rebuild all its functional and structural biochemicals that were not made efficiently during your previous poor habits. The more damaged your current metabolism, the longer it will take for this process to be completed. </p> <p>By taking the time to follow the necessary steps in the SPII program to balance your hormones, you will heal your metabolism. When you have healed your metabolism, you are primed to lose fat weight, if needed. Once you have lost all your stored fat, you are through your transition. </p> <p><b>The Four Transition Stages </b> </p> <p>For most people, the transition to a healthy metabolism and optimal health consists of four main stages: <br> </p> <ul> <li> Initial starting point </li> <li> Healing phase </li> <li> Fat-burning phase </li> <li> Healed state </li> </ul> <p>Here is what to expect as you journey through your transition to health. You begin at your initial starting point and then enter a healing phase that may consist of a self-medicating phase. Then you enter a fat-burning phase-if you need to burn fat before you finally reach a healed state.</p> <p>Depending on your current metabolism, your body may skip the healing and/or fat-burning phases. </p> <p>Let's look at each stage in more detail.</p> <p><b>1. The Initial Starting Point</b></p> <p>The initial starting point is your current metabolism type and age when you start improving your habits and begin entering your transition. Listed below are the four metabolism types an individual can have: </p> <p>1. Insulin-sensitive with healthy adrenal glands<br> 2. Insulin-resistant with healthy adrenal glands<br> 3. Insulin-sensitive with burned-out adrenal glands<br> 4. Insulin-resistant with burned-out adrenal glands</p> <p>These metabolism types are not genetic but acquired. Everyone begins life insulin-sensitive with healthy adrenal glands.* It is only after years of poor nutrition and lifestyle habits that you may become insulin-resistant or have burned-out adrenal glands-or have both conditions.</p> <p>Your age and how long you have had your current metabolism affect the duration of your transition. The older you are and the longer your metabolism has been damaged, the longer it will take for you to complete your transition.</p> <p><b>Your Goal </b></p> <p><i>Your goal is to stay or become insulin-sensitive and to have healthy adrenal glands or to heal them. </i>Therefore, the goal is to have a metabolism where you are insulin-sensitive with healthy adrenal glands.</p> <p>If you are starting out with this metabolism, your transition to healing requires improving your daily habits to keep from damaging your metabolism.</p> <p>If you start out insulin-resistant with healthy adrenal glands, your goal is to become insulin-sensitive and keep your adrenal glands healthy.</p> <p>If your current metabolism is insulin-sensitive with burned-out adrenal glands, your goal is to stay insulin-sensitive and heal your adrenal glands.</p> <p>If you are insulin-resistant with burned-out adrenal glands, you must heal both sides of your metabolism to reach your goal of insulin-sensitive with healthy adrenal glands.</p> <p><b>Insulin-Sensitive </b></p> <p>You are insulin-sensitive if your body responds to all the actions of insulin, including the ability to make and store fats. Refer to chapter 5 for an expanded explanation of what insulin does. Note, however, that just as with insulin resistance, you can gain fat weight around your midsection when you are insulin-sensitive. Therefore, do not confuse having excess fat weight around your midsection with being insulin-resistant (see below).</p> <p><b>Insulin-Resistant</b></p> <p>You are insulin-resistant if you have an elevated fasting insulin level with one or more of the following signs/disorders: excess fat weight around your midsection, high triglyceride levels and low HDL levels, high blood pressure, Type II diabetes, and/or coronary artery disease. You will probably need to ask your physician to order a fasting insulin and cholesterol profile in order to determine if you are insulin-resistant or not. Or visit my Web site at: www.SchwarzbeinPrinciple.com, to find out how you can be tested.</p> <p>There are three paths that lead to insulin resistance:</p> <ul> <li> Years of high insulin levels due to poor nutrition and lifestyle habits. </li> <li> Years of high adrenaline and/or cortisol levels due to poor nutrition and lifestyle habits. </li> <li> Years of high insulin, adrenaline and cortisol levels due to poor nutrition and lifestyle habits. </li> </ul> <p>If you recognize that you are on any of these paths, now is the time to change your habits! </p> <p>Are you insulin-sensitive, insulin-resistant or on the way to becoming insulin-resistant? Identify yourself here (check one):</p> <p>___I am insulin-sensitive.<br> ___I am insulin-sensitive on the way to insulin-resistant. <br> ___I am insulin-resistant.<br> ___I am not sure, so I will ask my physician to order blood tests.</p> <p><b>Are Your Adrenal Glands Healthy or Burned Out?</b></p> <p>Your adrenal glands make both adrenaline and cortisol. Years of oversecreting these two hormones can burn out your adrenal glands. If you have burned out your adrenal glands, you need to restore their function before you can achieve optimum health. </p> <p>You have healthy adrenal glands if you can stop all your high-adrenaline and/or cortisol habits cold turkey without experiencing withdrawal symptoms and completely falling apart emotionally and/or physically. </p> <p>If you are addicted to white sugar, caffeine, nicotine, diet pills, alcohol, overexercising and/or street drugs, or if you are always tired, have a "fuzzy" brain or cannot handle stressful situations, your adrenal glands are probably burned out. </p> <p>Your adrenal glands are burned out if your adrenal saliva test shows low cortisol levels throughout the day. Ask your physician to test your adrenal glands or visit my Web site, www.SchwarzbeinPrinciple.com, to find out how you can be tested.</p> <p>Do you have healthy or burned-out adrenal glands? Are you on the path to burning them out? Identify yourself here (check one): <br> </p> <p>___I have healthy adrenal glands.<br> ___I have healthy adrenal glands, but I am on the path to burning them out. <br> ___I have burned-out adrenal glands. <br> ___I am not sure, so I will ask my physician to test my adrenal gland function through saliva testing. </p> <p>Now, put together your insulin status and your adrenal gland state to identify your current metabolism type (check one):</p> <p>___I am insulin-sensitive and have healthy adrenal glands.<br> ___I am insulin-resistant and have healthy adrenal glands. <br> ___I am insulin-sensitive and have burned-out adrenal glands. <br> ___I am insulin-resistant and have burned-out adrenal glands.</p> <p>Note: If you are not sure what your current type is and you want to start this program before your laboratory tests are back, consider yourself insulin-sensitive with burned-out adrenal glands.</p> <p><b>2. The Healing Phase</b></p> <p>In the healing phase your body will repair itself from the damage caused by years of poor nutrition and lifestyle habits. You always have higher insulin than adrenaline/cortisol levels during this phase because this is a rebuilding time. </p> <p>It may seem as if you are in suspended animation during this phase because though you are healing, it doesn't feel or seem that way. As you improve your habits, you are rebuilding your biochemicals at a much higher rate than you are using them up, and this causes you to feel tired and to gain fat weight.</p> <p><b>Your Current Metabolism Is Revealed During the Healing Phase</b></p> <p>During the healing phase you expose your current metabolism because your hormones will react to your new and improved nutrition and lifestyle habits and reflect their true state.</p> <p>If you are insulin-sensitive, your insulin levels will fluctuate appropriately with your carbohydrate intake; if you are insulin-resistant, your insulin levels will stay high while you are healing. </p> <p>For example, if you are insulin-sensitive, your fasting insulin levels are within normal ranges, and when you eat carbohydrates, your levels rise to match your carbohydrate intake so your body can process the food. Once you process your food, your insulin levels come back down to normal. </p> <p>But if you are insulin-resistant, your fasting insulin levels are already higher than normal, and they will stay high, even if you improve your eating habits, until you have become insulin-sensitive again. </p> <p>If your adrenal glands are healthy, your adrenaline/cortisol levels will respond appropriately to your habits; if your adrenal glands are burned out, your adrenaline/cortisol levels will stay low until your glands have had a chance to heal. You have worn them out and depleted their ability to respond as they would under normal circumstances.</p> <p><b>What Happens to Your Hormone During the Healing Phase</b></p> <p>Here is what happens to your hormones during your healing phase-depending upon your current metabolism.</p> <p>If you are insulin-sensitive with healthy adrenal glands, your hormones will immediately become balanced when you improve your habits; therefore, you are instantly through your healing phase. </p> <p>If you are insulin-resistant with healthy adrenal glands, your insulin levels will remain high despite your improved habits until your body has a chance to heal and you become insulin-sensitive again. However, your adrenaline/cortisol levels will normalize immediately.</p> <p>If you are insulin-sensitive with burned-out adrenal glands, your insulin levels will respond appropriately to your improved habits, but your adrenaline and cortisol levels will stay low while your adrenal glands heal; they will normalize when you have completely healed. </p> <p>If you are insulin-resistant with burned-out adrenal glands, your insulin levels will remain high, and your adrenaline/cortisol levels will remain low. As you heal, your insulin and adrenaline/cortisol levels will slowly normalize.</p> <p><b>How Your Body Heals</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, your body will not start working efficiently the moment you improve your habits. As previously stated, you did not damage your metabolism overnight, and you will not heal it overnight. During the healing phase, you are still hormonally out of balance. As your body begins to correct this imbalance, you may experience any number of disturbing symptoms. </p> <p>For example, as your adrenaline/cortisol levels drop, you may feel withdrawal symptoms such as fatigue, irritability and depression. As your insulin levels rise, you may gain fat weight and/or experience salt and water retention. </p> <p>The more damaged your current metabolism is, the longer you will need to stay in the healing phase and the more fat your body produces. In fact, as your ratio of insulin to adrenaline/cortisol increases, your symptoms will worsen. </p> <p>As awful as this may sound, this is your body's only way to heal. So do not be put off by the healing phase-it is simply a reflection of the damage that came before it. <br> Since insulin is a rebuilding hormone and adrenaline and cortisol are using-up hormones, you can only heal from years of using up your biochemicals by rebuilding them-this means higher insulin-to- adrenaline/cortisol levels. Unfortunately, even though you begin to improve your habits, the damage has already been done by your previous poor habits. Therefore, you will not instantly reap the rewards of your better habits.</p> <p>For example, when people stop smoking, they may gain a lot of fat weight and feel tired and listless. They usually tell me they never should have stopped smoking because now they feel lousy and are fat besides. </p> <p>What they don't realize is that the only way their bodies can heal is by raising their insulin levels higher than their adrenaline levels, so they will gain fat weight as their bodies heal from years of smoking. The damage occurred while they were smoking, not after they stopped. The only way to avoid having to heal from smoking is to never smoke in the first place. </p> <p>If you are a smoker, the best thing you can do for your health is to quit and begin healing from years of using up your biochemicals more than rebuilding them due to nicotine use.</p> <p>There is a subpart to the healing phase: the self-medicating phase. The self-medicating phase occurs whenever you do anything that raises your adrenaline/cortisol levels closer to your insulin levels. </p> <p><b>The Self-Medicating Phase</b></p> <p>Since your insulin levels must be higher than your adrenaline/cortisol levels for your body to heal, it does not always feel very good to be in the healing phase of your transition. It is during this time that the self-medicating phase becomes important in keeping you on the path to restoring your metabolism.</p> <p>In this phase you use one or more of the following to make yourself feel good enough to continue your healing process: small amounts of stimulants, alcohol and refined sugars. Overexercising is also a form of self-medication. Self-medicating makes you feel better in the short-term because using up your biochemicals always feels better than rebuilding them.</p> <p>In the self-medicating phase you still have higher insulin than adrenaline/cortisol levels, but you narrow the gap between your rate of rebuilding and using up. Your self-medicating habits raise your adrenaline/cortisol levels closer to your insulin levels, and you prolong your transition because self-medicating keeps you closer to your current metabolism than to your goal metabolism.</p> <p>It is sometimes necessary to self-medicate to get through your transition, especially if you begin with burned-out adrenal glands. The How To section outlines the best ways to self-medicate if you need to.</p> <p>Do not make the mistake of thinking you are self-medicating if you have not changed any of your habits! You cannot "be good" part of the time and revert to your poor habits the rest of the time. If you over- self-medicate and your adrenaline/cortisol levels get higher than your insulin levels, you will no longer be in your transition process, and you will continue to damage your metabolism. </p> <p><b>3. The Fat-Burning Phase</b></p> <p>The fat-burning phase of the transition occurs after your body has done all its rebuilding in the healing phase. The main changes to your body composition during the healing phase is an increase in lean body tissue, such as muscles and bones rather than a decrease in fat weight per se. However, do not get discouraged, you will have started to burn off some of your excess fat-weight during the healing phase and are now ready to burn off the rest.</p> <p>You begin your fat-burning phase only after your hormones are completely normalized and ...</p></p><h2>Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace: How We Got to Be So Hated</h2><p>The United States has been engaged in what the great historian Charles A. Beard called "perpetual war for perpetual peace." The Federation of American Scientists has cataloged nearly 200 military incursions since 1945 in which the United States has been the aggressor. In a series of penetrating and alarming essays, whose centerpiece is a commentary on the events of September 11, 2001 (deemed too controversial to publish in this country until now) Gore Vidal challenges the comforting consensus following September 11th and goes back and draws connections to Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City. He asks were these simply the acts of "evil-doers?" "Gore Vidal is the master essayist of our age." &#x2014; Washington Post "Our greatest living man of letters."&#x2014;Boston Globe "Vidal's imagination of American politics is so powerful as to compel awe."&#x2014;Harold Bloom, The New York Review of Books</p><p>In this collection of essays, noted novelist and critic Vidal turns his acerbic wit on the United States. Never shy about expressing his opinion, Vidal questions U.S. assumptions regarding the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings: "That our ruling junta might have seriously provoked McVeigh and Osama was never dealt with." His critique of the coverage of September 11 is slim, mostly centering on already reported truisms about why many in the Muslim world sympathize in some way with Osama bin Laden. Some readers, however, will share his unease with the willingness on the part of the American government and the American people to put concerns for civil liberties on the back burner during the war on terrorism. Vidal's criticisms of McVeigh, with whom he struck up a correspondence and a relationship, is more detailed. In Vidal's view, it is unlikely that McVeigh was solely responsible for Oklahoma City, and he saw himself as a martyr for a libertarian cause that would rescue America. But in this book, the tone is as important as the text. Vidal gleefully skewers American capitalism and the role of the religious right in American politics at every opportunity. Critics of American policy and American life, as well as those prone to conspiracy theories, are likely to find a lot of fodder. Many will not be surprised that Vidal's views have not received a wider hearing a piece on McVeigh was rejected by Vanity Fair, another by the Nation but even at his most contrarian, Vidal's writing is powerful and graceful. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.Vidal couldn't find an English-language publisher for the first essay in this collection, his response to September 11, until it became a best-seller in Italy. He argues that Osama bin Laden's attack on America pales in comparison to the government's attack on American civil liberties since September 11. Vidal views the unwinnable wars on terrorism and drugs as the government's excuse to implement a police state, which he repeatedly compares to Nazi Germany. With his trademark wit and imposing intellect, he attacks everything about the Bush administration's response to 9/11, from the president's characterization of terrorists as "evil" to the war in Afghanistan. The clever, thoughtful diatribe is sometimes overwhelmed by tangents (at one point, Vidal ridicules Barbara Bush as a George Washington look-alike, which hardly seems relevant), but the essay is compulsively readable. The remaining essays in this slim volume have been published before and address Timothy McVeigh and the bombing in Oklahoma City. In a surprisingly convincing argument that McVeigh might not have been behind the bombing, Vidal weaves conspiracies from the Opus Dei order of the Catholic Church to Waco. These essays are held together by Vidal's belief that we must take the McVeighs and the bin Ladens of the world seriously and not dismiss their actions as simply "evil." Vidal fans will find everything they love here: these essays are witty, often convincing, and pull no punches. <i>John Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The Fred Harvey Company surprised travelers, who were accustomed to &#x201c;dingy beaneries&#x201d; staffed with &#x201c;rough waiters,&#x201d; by presenting attractive, courteous servers known as the Harvey Girls. Today many Harvey Houses serve as museums, offices, and civic centers throughout the Southwest. Only a few Harvey Houses remain as first-class hotels, and they are located at the Grand Canyon, in Winslow, Arizona, and in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><p>While whole books have been written about the Santa Fe Railway, the Harvey Girls, and even the Harvey House china, recipes, and menus, not one has been published about the Harvey Houses themselves. In this volume, author and professor of history at the University of New Mexico&#x2019;s Valencia campus Richard Melzer has compiled more than 180 rare historical photographs and other memorabilia to tell the unique story of the Harvey Houses. Dr. Melzer also serves as the president of the Historical Society of New Mexico and has been a longtime docent at the Harvey House Museum in his hometown of Belen, New Mexico.Title: Civilizing the Old West<br><br>Author: David Steinberg<br><br>Publisher: Albuquerque Journal<br><br>Date: 1/18/2009<br>Judy Garland was a Harvey Girl, if only in film. Garland starred in the 1946 movie "The Harvey Girls," which featured the Oscar-winning song "On the Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe."<br>In real life, the Harvey Girls were waitresses at the popular Harvey Houses, which British immigrant Fred Harvey had started in the 1880s. The houses &#x2015; really, restaurants, curio shops and in some cases hotels &#x2015; catered to tourists who traveled by train between Chicago and Los Angeles. Most Fred Harvey Houses were at stations along the Santa Fe Railway in the Southwest, such as the razed Alvarado Hotel in Albuquerque and La Casta�eda in Las Vegas, N.M. A few others, like La Fonda in downtown Santa Fe and the Montezuma outside of Las Vegas, were luxury hotels miles from the rail stop. The heyday of the houses was in the 1920s. Business dropped off in the next decade with the Great Depression and the rising competition from automobile travel.<br>Historian Richard Melzer of Belen has put together a book of vintage photographs and picture postcards that captures the bustle of activities at the famous businesses, the life of the waitresses and other employees and the tourists who visited.<br>Garland may not have visited a Harvey House, but a photo (c. 1925) in Melzer's book shows actors Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Mary Pickford with Albuquerque Mayor Clyde Tingley. The caption says the actors were frequent Alvarado visitors.<br>Melzer came to the subject because of his long association as a docent with the Valencia County Historical Society, of which he is currently vice president. The society operates Belen's Harvey House Museum.<br>"A lot of people take the Rail Runner to Belen, and that's the place they like to visit," the 59-year-old Melzer said. "It sits by the station."<br>Photos in the book show Harvey Houses located at Clovis, Gallup, Deming, San Marcial, Rincon, Vaughn and, briefly, in Raton.<br>For the book, Melzer said he wrote the introduction and photo captions and was responsible for gathering the photographs.<br>Some of the proceeds of his book will go to support the museum, Melzer said.<br>He's invited former Harvey Girls who live in the Albuquerque area to attend his book event at Bookworks today .<br>Melzer, who is also president of the Historical Society of New Mexico, teaches two New Mexico history classes at the UNM Valencia campus in which he discusses the Harvey Houses.<br>Besides La Fonda, several former Harvey Houses are still operating as hotels, according to Melzer. They are El Tovar and Bright Angel at the Grand Canyon, one at Winslow, Ariz., and another in Needles, Calif.<br>The Albuquerque Museum will present the exhibit "Jewel of the Railroad Era: Albuquerque's Alvarado Hotel," which opens March 8. It will be up through June 7. In conjunction with the exhibit, the museum is publishing Deb Slaney's book of the same title.<br>Melzer wrote the introduction for a newly released history book. It is titled "The Whole Damned World: New Mexico Aggies at War: 1941-1945, World War II Correspondence of Dean Daniel B. Jett" edited by Martha Shipman Andrews. (NMSU Library/Rio Grande Books).

In Asterix one finds all of human life. The fact that the books were written originally in French is no matter.

Bolton</i>, <i>Abuse of Discretion</i> is a critical review of the behind-the-scenes deliberations that went into the Supreme Court's abortion decisions and how the mistakes made by the Justices in 1971-1973 have led to the turmoil we see today in legislation, politics, and public health. <br><br>The first half of the book looks at the mistakes made by the Justices, based on the case files, the oral arguments, and the Justices&#x2019; papers. The second half of the book critically examines the unintended consequences of the abortion decisions in law, politics, and women&#x2019;s health.<br><br>Why do the abortion decisions remain so controversial after almost 40 years, despite more than 50,000,000 abortions, numerous presidential elections, and a complete turnover in the Justices? Why did such a sweeping decision with such important consequences for public health, producing such prolonged political turmoil come from the Supreme Court in 1973? <br><br>Answering those questions is the aim of this book. The controversy over the abortion decisions has hardly subsided, and the reasons why are to be found in the Justices&#x2019; deliberations in 1971-1972 that resulted in the unprecedented decision they issued.<br><br>Discuss <i>Abuse of Discretion</i> on Twitter using hashtag <b>#AbuseOfDiscretion</b>.<br></p><p>Clarke D. Forsythe is Senior Counsel at Americans United for Life. Clarke has a B.A. from Allegheny College, a J.D. from Valparaiso University, and an M.A. in Bioethics from Trinity International University. Clarke has been co-counsel for parties in three U.S. Supreme Court cases, has argued cases before federal and state appellate courts and has testified before Congress and state legislatures. He is the author of <i>Politics for the Greatest Good: The Case for Prudence in the Public Square</i> (InterVarsity Press (IVP), 2009). Clarke and his wife, married for 31 years, have five daughters.When <i>Roe v. Wade</i> and <i>Doe v. Bolton</i> were first decided, leading constitutional scholars like Paul Freund, John Hart Ely, and Archibald Cox were severely critical. Though unopposed to statutory reform of abortion law, they expressed deep concerns about the legal foundations of those decisions, and the likely consequences of the Supreme Court&#x2019;s sweeping judicial over-reach. Now, Clarke Forsythe has proved the worst fears of these legal titans were more than justified. <i>Abuse of Discretion</i> not only exposes the legal and factual errors the Court made in 1972, but meticulously documents the far-reaching and deleterious effects of the Court&#x2019;s rush to judgment.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Mary Ann Glendon</b>, Learned Hand Professor of Law, Harvard University<br> Whatever your opinions on abortion, this book raises troubling questions about the lack of information, and in some cases blatant misinformation, on which the Court decided the abortion issue in 1973. If the courts take upon themselves the authority to decide moral and medical questions of this importance, it is not too much to ask that they adhere to rigorous standards of evidence.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Michael W. McConnell</b>, Richard &amp; Frances Mallery Professor and Director of the Constitutional Law Center, Stanford Law School<br> This is an astonishing, amazing, inside-peek at the process that produced one of America's most controversial constitutional decisions of all time. By scouring through the justices' personal papers, Clarke Forsythe has done an incredible job of unearthing the secret story of how and why the Supreme Court decided <i>Roe v. Wade</i> as it did. This is original and insightful history.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Michael Stokes Paulsen</b>, University Chair &amp; Professor of Law<br>The University of St. Thomas<br> The Supreme Court's creation of a constitutional right to abortion in the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> case is widely acknowledged to be completely indefensible as a matter of constitutional law. In this fine book, Clarke Forsythe, one of our finest constitutional scholars writing on abortion jurisprudence, explores not only the legal weaknesses of <i>Roe</i> and its progeny, but also the astonishing medical and public policy errors on which the decision was based. This is a landmark work on abortion, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Stephen B. Presser</b>, Raoul Berger Professor of Legal History<br>Northwestern University School of Law<br> The importance of judges following proper procedure is critical to insure equal justice under law&#x2019; (the ideal inscribed on the U.S. Supreme Court building) not only to protect the parties but to justify American citizens' faith in our judicial institutions. That is why Clarke Forsythe's examination in <i>Abuse of Discretion</i> is such a critical piece of legal history. With more than 25 years of legal experience researching, writing and lawyering about abortion issues, Mr. Forsythe is imminently qualified to write this important book. Mr. Forsythe's remarkable, revelatory research merits the most careful consideration. It has the potential to reshape our view (and the future) of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Lynn D.

As Lewis White Beck points out in the Foreword to this edition, those who know Kant only from his rigorous and abstract intellectual critiques may be surprised by the accessibility of these essays, which put flesh on the bones of the critical ethics, while revealing Kant as a practical moralist, greatly concerned with the nuances of human conduct and the social effects of his moral teaching. The sharply focused discussions and definitions strengthen an interpretation of Kant's more mature speculative works and remain the riches document we have for understanding the history of the preeminent ethical theory of modern times.</p></p><p>This volume contains four versions of the lecture notes taken by Kant&#39;s students of his university courses in ethics given regularly over a period of some thirty years. The notes are very complete and expound not only Kant&#39;s views on ethics but many of his opinions on life and human nature. Much of this material has never before been translated into English. As with other volumes in the series, there are copious linguistic and explanatory notes and a glossary of key terms.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Stand Out 3: Workbook</h2><p>Stand Out: Workbook 3 Evidence-Based Learning for College and Career Readiness 3rd Edition by Staci Johnson, Rob Jenkins Product details Paperback Publisher: CENGAGE Learning Custom Publishing; 3rd Revised edition edition Language: English ISBN-10: 1305655540 ISBN-13: 9781305655546 Product Dimensions: 8.4 x 0.4 x 10.9 inches</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Natural Language Processing (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series)</h2><p><p><b>A survey of computational methods for understanding, generating, and manipulating human language, which offers a synthesis of classical representations and algorithms with contemporary machine learning techniques.</b></p><p>This textbook provides a technical perspective on natural language processing&#x2015;methods for building computer software that understands, generates, and manipulates human language.

Not long ago the meeting in the great banqueting hall had ended, and her mother had been called from the Grianan by her father. Since then Erin had kept her vigil by the window, for she desperately wanted to seek out her father.<br><br>She chewed upon her lower lip as she waited impatiently to see her parents return from their walk. It was a beautiful scene she stared upon. The verdant green grass dazzled beneath the sun until it appeared as a field of glistening emeralds, and in the distance the little brook that rounded the southernmost dun took on the hue of sapphires. Geese ambled about the brook, and cows and horses grazed lazily upon the hills.<br><br>Yet today Erin could not focus on the beauty and peace spread before her. She stared upon the grass and sky feeling as if the world spun. She could not help being haunted by memories. Visions of the past took precedence over reality, and although she swallowed furiously and blinked, the memories remained of fire, of blood, and the trample of horses' hooves that was like a thunderous beat. . . .<br><br>Mist seemed to settle over the sunblaze of the golden afternoon, and she saw herself too clearly, two years past, as she sat with her aunt, Bridget of Clonntairth, in the garden. Bridget, sweet, beautiful Bridget, had been laughing so gaily. But then the alarm had come and Bridget had forced Erin to flee. Erin had turned back in time to see Bridget burying her small pearl-handled dagger deep into her own heart in terror of the Norsemen coming. Then high-pitched screams had risen and risen to vie with the terrible drum-beat of the Norsemen's horses as they bore down upon her uncle's kingdom of Clonntairth.<br><br>Even now Erin could hear the bloodcurdling war cries of the Norsemen, the shrill wailing of the unprepared Irish. Even now she could smell the fire, hear the earth itself tremble with thunder. . . .<br><br>Erin blinked and forced herself to dispel the image. She drew in a deep breath and exhaled shakily, her excitement suddenly growing as she saw that her parents were at long last returning from the copse by the brook. She had sat with her eyes unwaveringly fixed on those trees since Maeve had been summoned, her fingers pulling knots in the threads of the robe she mended. In the two years since Clonntairth, she had tried to settle into living again. She had tried to enjoy being a princess of Tara, and she had tried very hard to convince her father and gentle mother that she had been able to put Clonntairth in the past, but she had never fogotten, and she never, never would.<br><br>She knew that today the kings and princes of Eire met to discuss their stand in the coming battle between the Danes and the Norwegians. And though she hated the Danes, she despised the Norwegians&#x2013;and one in particular: Olaf the White.<br><br>Just thinking his name made her palms grow damp, her body flush and tremble with fury and loathing.<br><br>Erin desperately wanted to know if the Irish chiefs who had debated all morning in the great banqueting hall would take a side; if they did, she prayed that they would not decide the Norwegians were the lesser of two evils.<br><br>"If you paid attention to your work, sister," Gwynn said sourly, interrupting her vigil, "your stitches would be small and neat. You should bring your head in from the window anyway. It hardly befits a princess to stare out with the ill-concealed nosiness of a farm wife!"<br><br>Erin started and drew her gaze from the window to glance at her older sister with a sigh of resignation. Gwynn had been picking at her all day, but Erin could feel no rancor in return. She knew that Gwynn was terribly unhappy.<br><br>Her marriage had been a dynastical one, to be sure, but Gwynn had been smitten by the young king of Antrim long before her royal wedding. Belatedly she had discovered that her prince's gallantry was the type to last only to the altar. Heith was handsome, suave, and charming, and now, with his wife five months pregnant and in her father's house, he was apparently practicing that charm on other women. But Gwynn dared not complain to her father; Aed would either chastise her for being a jealous wife or, worse still, vent the terrible rage he was generally known to control on her husband.<br><br>"You're right, sister," Erin said softly. "When I sew, I will try not to allow my mind to wander." She smiled at her sister, sensing the depth of misery that had taken Gwynn from a cheerful girl to a morose woman. "But you know, Gwynn, you always were the most talented of us! Mother used to despair of all our stitches, while applauding yours."<br><br>Gwynn slowly smiled in return, aware that she didn't particularly deserve the charity of one whom she had spent the day harassing. "I'm sorry, Erin, for truly I've been a miserable lot for you to draw today."<br><br>Erin dropped her stance at the window to go to her sister. She knelt beside her and placed her head briefly upon Gwynn's knees before meeting her eyes. "You are truly forgiven, Gwynn. I know that the babe makes you most uncomfortable!"<br><br>"Sweet Erin," Gwynn murmured, her eyes, so like her sister's, growing misty. Despite the bulk of her pregnancy, Gwynn was still a beautiful young woman. Her face lacked the ultimate perfection of her youngest sister's, but she had been sought by many a prince across the countryside. That fact made her life all the more bitter now. She laughed suddenly, for Erin had always been her favorite and guilt because of her harassment of her sister plagued her. "Off your knees, Erin! I'm behaving like an old witch, and you are humoring me. We all know it is not the babe who plagues me and makes me old before my time, but that worthless husband of mine."<br><br>"Gwynn!" Bride, the oldest sister, a matron now of three and a half decades and mother of grown sons, spoke sharply. "You should not speak so of your husband. He is your lord and you must give him homage."<br><br>Gwynn sniffed. "Homage! If I had any sense I would consult a Brehon and demand a separation. The laws declare that I would keep what's mine, which would hurt my noble husband. He would lose half his gambling assets!"<br><br>"Gwynn." The address came this time in a soft, quiet voice. It was Bede who spoke, and even the simple intonation of Gwynn's name was musical.<br><br>Bede had never possessed the beauty that even Bride still retained; her hair was a plain mouse brown, her face was thin. Her only true asset was the deep emerald eyes that she shared with her siblings.<br><br>She had always been the happiest of the brood, always able to find pleasure in the smallest things. That she had been promised to the church since birth had brought her complete happiness. She had joined her order at twelve and came home only for special feasts. She was here today because her father had requested that all his family be present, and as Ard-Righ his word was law.<br><br>"I do not believe you would be happy to set your husband aside," Bede said wisely, "for you love him still. Perhaps when the babe is born, things will improve. Remember your pride, sister, but remember too that time can be your friend. When trysts of the night have long since passed, you will still be wife and mother of his heirs."<br><br>Still at Gwynn's knees, Erin glanced at Bede's sweet face. Her sister's intuition was often startling. A nun Bede might be, but she was far from innocent or sheltered. She met the world with commendable good sense.<br><br>Gwynn sighed. "You are right, sister. I would not set the man aside for I am fool enough to love him. I crave him; I accept the crumbs of his affection and weep and scream when I discover his wenching! But . . . still I love him, and so I believe, as Bede suggests, that I will dazzle his heart again. When the babe is born. . . ." Her lashes lowered as she sighed and gazed once more upon Erin. "Do forgive me, sister. I thought to inflict misery upon you because I have become such a bitter wretch! You are wise, Erin, and in my jealousy I resent your wisdom in not marrying. Never marry! And never, never be foolish enough to love! Give your heart to God as Bede has done, if you would, but never, never let it be trampled by mortal man!"<br><br>"What rubbish you feed her!" Bride interrupted with derision. "She is past the age she should have married already, and you would have her go merrily on playing swordsman with our brothers until all hear of her lack of maidenliness and despair of her! She is the daughter of Aed Finnlaith! It is her duty to wed, as we have, sister, to better our alliances and hold safe our father's and brother's crowns!"<br><br>Bede, still and dark in her long black habit, suddenly moved impatiently. "Bride, leave the girl be&#x2013;"<br><br>"I will not!" Bride snorted. "Father fears for her feelings like a foolish, besotted old man! Well, Clonntairth was a fact of life and Erin must get over it."<br><br>Mention of Clonntairth suddenly reminded Erin how faithfully she had watched for her parents to return. If she didn't hurry now, she would miss her father before he sent his servants for his bath, and then she would not be able to speak to him till late in the night.<br><br>She hopped to her feet, aware that her unseemly hurry would send Bride to Maeve with warning tales of woe, but Bride would not be at Tara much longer. When the meeting split and the tribes broke, Bride would return to her own province with her husband and sons. "Excuse me, sisters," Erin muttered. Then she fled them and the Grianan, smiling and acknowledging the other ladies who sat about sewing and conversing.<br><br>As she reached the open air, Erin overheard her father speaking with her mother about the meal that would be served that evening. Erin did not want to see her mother. Maeve was not half so critical as Bride, but she would look at Erin with such weary sadness that the young woman would feel riddled with guilt. Erin didn't believe she would ever capture any of Maeve's qualities of kindness and sweetness.<br><br>She allowed herself a brief, wry smile. She was justly proud of both her parents. Aed Finnlaith was the High King of Eire, ruling over a number of lesser, constantly squabbling Irish kings. A magnificent warrior, he had banded the Irish together with a force greater than any king before him. And still he had always been a tender, loving father and husband. When his heart and soul were clouded by worries such as today, he would seek out his Maeve, and she would always lighten his heart with gentle laughter and wit and amusing tales from the rivalry within the Grianan.<br><br>To avoid a confrontation with both parents, Erin slipped around to the rear of the Grianan and paused by the gnarled trunk of a great tree. Her father would have to pass her to reach the handsomely adorned building that was their residence.<br><br>As she waited, she bit her lip. She would have to watch each of her words carefully. She didn't want her father to know that vengeance was the ruling factor in her heart.<br><br>A crackle in the velvet-green grass warned her of her father's approach. Erin looked up, smiling to meet him.<br><br>"Father!"<br><br>Aed raised his graying red head and smiled warmly in return. "Daughter! How sweet of you to come and ease the strains of a tired old man. You are a breath of spring to see, my Erin."<br><br>Erin went to his side and accepted his hug.<br><br>"What do you here, daughter?"<br><br>Erin shrugged. "I've come to walk with you a spell, Father."<br><br>Aed stopped in his tracks and stared down into her face, raising his brow doubtfully. "Come to walk with me, have you, minx? Or to ply me with questions?"<br><br>Erin grimaced. "Well, I would like to hear the decision of the council."<br><br>Aed looked at her long and hard. She was an uncommon beauty, this last of his ten children. In her eyes was all the green beauty of the land; in her shapely and straight form, its strength. Beneath the sun her ebony hair gleamed gloriously, framing a face that was both fair and sharply intelligent, and in no need of powders or paints. His daughter's skin was like a rose petal, soft and fair and naturally blushed. He took a terrible pride in her. She understood every nuance of politics, she read with a comprehension superior to any of her brothers', and she wrote with a beautiful hand. Her voice, like Bede's, was like a melody, and she could play the harp, surpassing her sisters in talent.<br><br>And she had a wicked sword arm. Though his sons complained, Aed would not refuse his daughter's tutelag by their masters. He was secretly pleased when she would best her brothers, and he silenced his boys' grumblings with the reminder that they must work even harder. If their sister could bring them to their knees, what would a Norseman do?<br><br>But now Aed frowned with her query. He had watched her carefully since the day she had stumbled home cross country after the Viking raid at Clonntairth with only her half-crazed cousin Gregory beside her.<br><br>Clonntairth had been destroyed. Its buildings razed, its people taken in slavery by the Norwegians. Yet by crawling through wreckage and ancient tunnels, Erin and Gregory had escaped. Aed had had to send Gregory to the monks at Armagh. But Erin had been strong and recuperated at home, living on hate.<br><br>Aed was a wise man who knew hate could lead to desperate gestures. It was not a feeling one could forget, but neither was it one that should be fostered. Acting with passion but without wit was foolhardy. It could too easily lead to destruction.<br><br>He had tried to teach his daughter these things, yet despite her pleasantry, her apparent ease with the womanly arts, Aed knew that Erin still harbored her terrible hate. That it seemed to be a personal hate surprised and bewildered Aed. Bridget had died by her own hand; Brian, her husband, in battle. The attack had come from the troops of Olaf the White, a strangely merciful man for one of his heritage. He allowed no slaughter of children or of women; nor, for that matter, would he allow the senseless murder of warriors. That those conquered became slaves was but the way of the world, and slaves did not always live in misery. It was said that the vassals of the Norwegian Wolf ate better than many a prince and were clothed in wool in the winters.<br><br>Aed stared at her a moment longer and then shrugged. "They have chosen to support the Danish princes, for the Danes have sworn to pray to Saint Patrick and offer up great riches to his honor should he help them in battle. And"&#x2013;Aed paused a moment, but he could hold few secrets from Erin's sharp mind&#x2013;"and I am glad we support the Danes, for I believe they will take the coming battle. They are stronger now; they are united."<br><br>Erin lowered her lashes and smiled, but not before her father saw the glitter of pleasure in her eyes. "Don't take this to mean much, daughter," he warned sharply. "I believe the decision we make means less than the time it took to come to. We do not raise arms for the Danes. They too are murdering barbarians, no matter what cloak they wear. Oh, a few Irish tribes will fight. But I warrant, despite the decision reached here today, that a few Irish tribes will also fight on the side of the Norsemen. I tell you this, daughter: I will be glad to see the Norwegians fall, but we pass merely from one set of hawks to the next. The Viking is here to stay, and I care not his nationality. In the years to come, we must look to men carefully, and weigh our enemies."<br><br>Erin nodded, although she wasn't particularly interested in her father's wisdom at the moment. She kept her eyes carefully downcast, for she dreaded her father re...</p><h2>Deadwood: 1876-1976 (SD) (Images of America)</h2><p>Think about the most romantically notorious Wild West town you ever heard of, and most likely Deadwood would head the list. Deadwood has more than its share of legends, heroes, and brigands who traveled through or made their homes here: Wild Bill and Calamity Jane to be sure, but also Buffalo Bill, Wyatt Earp, Captain Jack Crawford (the &#x201c;Poet Scout&#x201d;), California Joe, Seth Bullock, Poker Alice, and many more. No other frontier town&#x2015;not Dodge City, Tombstone, Abilene, or Cripple Creek&#x2015;could claim them all. Deadwood is the champion, and was the happening place in the late 1870s. This legacy lives on today as casino gambling&#x2015;perhaps ironically but fittingly&#x2015;financed the preservation of historic downtown Deadwood begining in 1989, an area that is now designated a National Historic Landmark.</p><p>Author Bev Pechan and photographer Bill Groethe have teamed up for their second Images of America title.

Ellie&#x2019;s ordinary appearance belies the truth: She is in fact Lady Elyne de Burgh, the spirited daughter of the most powerful noble in Ireland. <br><br>Worse, this irresistible woman is determined to prove herself immune to Erik&#x2019;s charms&#x2014;a challenge he cannot resist. Her captor may look every inch a rugged warrior, but Ellie vows that it will take more than a wickedly suggestive caress to impress her.

Still, he is a man driven by loyalty, and she is a woman with secrets that could jeopardize Bruce&#x2019;s chance to reclaim his throne.

Monica McCarty lives in the San Francisco Bay Area with her husband and their two children.Rathlin Sound, off the north coast of Ireland<br> &nbsp;<br> Candlemas, February 2, 1307<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik MacSorley never could resist a challenge, even an unspoken one. One glimpse of the fishing boat being pursued by the English galley and he knew tonight would be no different.<br> &nbsp;<br> What he should do was ignore it and continue on his mission, slipping undetected past the English patrol ship on his way to Dunluce Castle to meet with the Irish mercenaries.<br> &nbsp;<br> But what fun would there be in that?<br> &nbsp;<br> After over four months of hiding and hopping from island to island with nothing more than a brief foray to the mainland to collect Bruce&#x2019;s rents and the occasional reconnaissance mission, Erik and his men deserved a wee bit of excitement.<br> &nbsp;<br> He&#x2019;d been as good as a monk at Lent (except for the lasses, but Erik sure as hell hadn&#x2019;t taken a vow of chastity when he joined Bruce&#x2019;s Highland Guard), staying out of trouble and exercising unnatural restraint the few times he&#x2019;d been called to action since the storm and their escape from Dunaverty. But with Devil&#x2019;s Point practically in pissing distance, a high tide, and a strong wind at his back, it was too tempting an opportunity to let go by.<br> &nbsp;<br> At nine and twenty, Erik had yet to meet a wind he could not harness, a man who could best him on or in the water, a boat he could not outmaneuver, or, he thought with a devilish grin, a woman who could resist him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tonight would be no different. The heavy mist made it a perfect night for a race, especially since he could navigate the treacherous coast of Antrim blind.<br> &nbsp;<br> They&#x2019;d just skirted around the northwest corner of Rathlin Island, on their way south to Dunluce Castle on the northern coast of Ireland, when they caught sight of the English patrol boat near Ballentoy Head. Ever since the English had taken Dunaverty Castle earlier this month and realized Bruce had fled Scotland, the enemy fleet had increased their patrols in the North Channel hunting the fugitive king.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Erik didn&#x2019;t like seeing a patrol boat this close to his destination. The best way to ensure the English didn&#x2019;t interfere with his plans was to put them someplace they couldn&#x2019;t give him any trouble. Besides, from the looks of it, the fishermen could use a little help.<br> &nbsp;<br> English bastards. The treacherous murder of MacLeod&#x2019;s clansmen was still fresh in his mind. And they called him a pirate.<br> &nbsp;<br> He gave the order to raise the sail.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; Sir Thomas Randolph sputtered in a hushed voice. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll see us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik sighed and shook his head. Bruce owed him. Acting nursemaid to the king&#x2019;s pompous nephew was not what he&#x2019;d signed up for. The king might have to add a castle or two to the land in Kintyre he&#x2019;d promised to restore to him when Bruce reclaimed his crown and kicked Edward Longshanks back to England.<br> &nbsp;<br> Randolph was so steeped in the code of chivalry and his knightly &#x201c;duties&#x201d; that he made Alex Seton&#x2014;the sole knight (and Englishman) among the elite Highland Guard&#x2014;seem lax. After two months of &#x201c;training&#x201d; Randolph, Erik had new respect for Seton&#x2019;s partner Robbie Boyd. Erik had heard enough about rules and honor to last him a bloody lifetime. Randolph was beginning to wear on even his notoriously easygoing nature.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik arched a brow with exaggerated laziness. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s rather the point if we&#x2019;re going to draw them away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But damn it, Hawk, what if they catch us?&#x201d; Randolph said, calling Erik by his nom de guerre&#x2014;his war name.<br> &nbsp;<br> When on a mission, war names were used to protect the identities of the Highland Guard, but as a seafarer Erik had no choice but to involve others. He needed men to man the oars, and with the other members of the Highland Guard scattered, he&#x2019;d turned to his own MacSorley clansmen. The handful of men who&#x2019;d accompanied Erik on this secret mission were his most trusted kinsmen and members of his personal retinue. They would protect his identity to the death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus far, the infamous &#x201c;Hawk&#x201d; sail had not been connected with the rumors spreading across the countryside of Bruce&#x2019;s phantom army, but he knew that could change at any moment.<br> &nbsp;<br> The oarsmen in hearing distance of Randolph laughed outright at the absurdity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t lost a race in...&#x201d; Erik turned questioningly to his second-in-command, Domnall, who shrugged.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hell if I know, Captain.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;See there,&#x201d; Erik said to Randolph with an easy grin. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But what about the silver?&#x201d; the young knight said stubbornly. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t risk the English getting their hands on it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The coin&#x2014;fifty pounds&#x2019; worth&#x2014;they carried was needed to secure the mercenaries. Small scouting parties had collected it over the winter months from Bruce&#x2019;s rents in Scotland. The nighttime forays had only added to the growing rumors of Bruce&#x2019;s phantom guard. MacSorley and some of the other guardsmen had been able to slip in and out of Scotland undetected thanks to key intelligence leaked from the enemy camp. Erik suspected he knew the source.<br> &nbsp;<br> Bruce hoped to triple the size of his fighting force with mercenaries. Without the additional men, the king wouldn&#x2019;t be able to mount the attack on the English garrisons occupying Scotland&#x2019;s castles and take back his kingdom.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was Erik&#x2019;s job to get them there. With the time of the attack approaching, Bruce was counting on him to secure the mercenaries and get them past the English fleet to Arran in time for the attack scheduled for the fifteenth&#x2014;less than two weeks away.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Relax, Tommy, lad,&#x201d; Erik said, knowing full well that the nobleman with the sword firmly wedged up his arse would only be antagonized further by the admonition. &#x201c;You sound like an old woman. The only thing they&#x2019;ll catch is our wake.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Randolph&#x2019;s mouth pursed so tightly his lips turned white, in stark contrast to his flushed face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Thomas,&#x201d; he growled, &#x201c;Sir Thomas, as you bloody well know. Our orders were to secure the mercenaries and arrange for them to join my uncle, without alerting the English patrols of our presence.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t quite that simple, but only a handful of people knew the entire plan, and Randolph wasn&#x2019;t one of them. They weren&#x2019;t arranging to have the mercenaries meet Bruce, they only were arranging the next meeting.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was safer that way. For Bruce to have any chance against the formidable English army, it was imperative that they have surprise on their side.<br> &nbsp;<br> After years of serving as a gallowglass mercenary in Ireland, Erik knew that it was wise to be cautious with information. Coin was the only loyalty most mercenaries honored, and the McQuillans were a rough lot&#x2014;to put it mildly.<br> &nbsp;<br> The king would not trust them with details of their plan until he had to, including both the location of the rendezvous and when and where they planned to attack. Erik would meet the Irish two nights before the attack, and then personally escort them to Rathlin to rendezvous with Bruce to assemble the army. The next night Erik would lead the entire fleet to Isle of Arran, where Bruce planned to launch the northern attack on the Scottish mainland set for the 15th of February.<br> &nbsp;<br> The timing was imperative. The king had divided his forces for a two-pronged attack. Bruce would attack at Turnberry, while his brothers led a second attack on the same day in the south at Galloway.<br> &nbsp;<br> With the timing so tight, and since they could travel only at night, there was no margin for error.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want any surprises, Tommy. This way we&#x2019;ll make sure of it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Nothing would interfere with his mission, but they could have a little fun doing it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s reckless,&#x201d; Randolph protested angrily.<br> &nbsp;<br> Erik shook his head. The lad really was hopeless. &#x201c;Now, Tommy, don&#x2019;t go throwing around words you don&#x2019;t understand. You wouldn&#x2019;t know reckless if it came up and bit you in the arse. It&#x2019;s reckless only if there is a chance they&#x2019;ll catch us, which&#x2014;as you&#x2019;ve already heard&#x2014;they won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> His men hoisted the square sail. The heavy wool fibers of the cloth coated with animal fat unfurled with a loud snap in the wind, revealing the fearsome black sea hawk on a white-and-gold striped background. The sight never ceased to send a surge of excitement pumping through his veins.<br> &nbsp;<br> A few moments later he heard a cry go up across the water. Erik turned to his disapproving companion with an unrepentant grin. &#x201c;Looks like it&#x2019;s too late, lad.

From lightly saut�ed spring greens and sea vegetables and refreshing summer salads, to harvest vegetables and hearty winter stews, <i>The Changing Seasons Macrobiotic Cookbook </i>provides hundreds of easy-to-follow and flavorful recipes for complete and balanced macrobiotic meals. A combination of great taste and whole foods, this is traditional macrobiotic cooking at its best.</p><p><b>Aveline Kushi</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s foremost experts on macrobiotic cooking. She began her study of macrobiotics in 1950, under the guidance of George Ohsawa, the founder of modern macrobiotics. She married Michio Kushi in 1952, and for the next ten years taught macrobiotic and natural cooking in New York.<br>&nbsp;<br>Michio and Aveline moved to Boston in 1965, and jointly established a variety of successful macrobiotic enterprises and educational ventures. Aveline&#x2019;s cooking classes in the Boston area attracted thousands of students, and she and Michio lectured extensively throughout the world.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Wendy Esko</b> is this country&#x2019;s leading author of macrobiotic cookbooks. She began practicing macrobiotics in 1971. Together with her husband Edward, and Michio and Aveline Kushi, she helped develop the East West Foundation, a non-profit educational organization. She began teaching macrobiotic cooking in 1976, and her studies of macrobiotics have taken her around the world.<br>Wendy teaches regularly at the Kushi Institute as well as throughout New England. She is the author of <i>Introducing Macrobiotic Cooking, </i>and <i>Macrobiotic Cooking for Everyone.</i><b>ONE<br><br>The Art of Cooking with the Seasons<br><br>THE STANDARD MACROBIOTIC DIET</b><p>The recipes in this cookbook are based on standard macrobiotic dietary recommendations that can be applied to your own kitchen. Certainly there is no one diet that is suited to every need. Modifications are always necessary, depending on where you are living, the type of climate there, the particular season, and your sex, age, job, personal condition, and level of activity. In the temperate, four-season climate that characterizes most of the United States, an optimum daily diet consists of the following general proportions of foods.<br><br><b>General Proportions, Optimum Daily Diet</b></p><p>The general proportions in the standard macrobiotic diet are based on the traditional dietary patterns that protected our ancestors from many of the degenerative disorders that we suffer from today. The diet also enables us to achieve harmony with changing environmental conditions. Until recent times, for example, cooked whole cereal grains were eaten as staple foods throughout the world: rice in the Orient; wheat, barley, rye, and oats in Europe and America; buckwheat or kasha in Russia and Central Europe; corn in the Americas; the millet, wheat, and other whole grains in Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Plus Beverages, Occasional Supplementary Foods, Seasonings, and Condiments</p><p>In Western countries, bread was the traditional &#x201c;staff of life,&#x201d; eaten in its whole, natural form until this century. The central place accorded to whole cereal grains in Europe and America is recorded in the prayer with which generations of people have begun each day: &#x201c;Give us this day our daily bread&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning food in general. In Japanese, the term used for a meal is gohan, which means rice, indicating the significance of whole cereal grains in the traditional Japanese diet.</p><p>Throughout the world, traditional diets have included fresh local vegetables and beans and their products along with whole grains. In many parts of the world, sea vegetables and other products from the oceans, together with a wide range of fermented foods such as naturally aged sauerkraut, pickled vegetables, miso, shoyu, and tempeh, were also traditional. In general, animal proteins, including meat, eggs, and dairy products, were used much less frequently than at present, while people in temperate climates rarely ate fruits and other products imported from the tropics.</p><p>Using whole grains, local vegetables, beans, and sea vegetables as our primary foods complements the structure and function of the human digestive system. Our thirty-two adult teeth are better suited for crushing and grinding plant fibers than they are for tearing animal flesh. We have twenty-eight incisors, premolars, and molars, which are best suited for grains, beans, and vegetables, but only four canine teeth, which can be used for tearing animal foods. According to the structure of our teeth, the ideal ratio between vegetable and animal foods is seven to one.</p><p>The length of the human digestive tract also favors the consumption of more plant than animal foods. Carnivores generally have relatively short intestines, to prevent the buildup of the harmful bacteria and toxins that accompany the decomposition of animal flesh. Because the human digestive tract is long and convoluted, it is not well suited to the consumption of a large volume of animal protein. The overintake of animal foods often leads to the buildup of harmful bacteria and toxins in the digestive tract and bloodstream, contributing to a variety of disorders.<br><br><b>MODIFYING THE DIET</b></p><p>In addition to eating according to our physical structure and traditional dietary practices, it is important for us to eat in a way that brings our condition into harmony with the environment around us. This can be done by relying primarily on foods that are grown in a climate similar to the one in which we live and by adjusting our selection of foods and cooking methods to accommodate the changing of the seasons.</p><p>In general, those who live in cold polar climates may consume a greater volume of animal food, while those in a hot, semitropical or tropical region can rely almost entirely on vegetable quality products. People living in an in-between, or four-season, climate may follow the traditional macrobiotic order in their diets, with cereal grains as the main foods; soup, vegetables, beans, and sea vegetables as secondary foods; fruits, nuts, and seeds as their third food group; and animal foods such as fish and seafood, which are biologically distant from the human species, as the fourth supplement.</p><p>If we move to another climatic region, we need to change the types of food that we select and our style of cooking to adapt to the new environment. Similarly, our diet can also be changed to suit fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and other conditions that come about as a result of the changing of the seasons. For example, we can harmonize our diet with the environment as follows:</p>MODIFICATIONS FOR CLIMATIC FACTORS&nbsp;LowerHigherTemperatureMore thorough cooking;<br>stronger seasoningShorter cooking times;<br>less seasoningHumidityMore water in cookingLess water in cooking<p><b>Geographic Range</b></p><p>Sometimes it is best to select foods from the immediate locality, and sometimes you may choose foods brought in from greater distances. The table on the following page provides some guidelines you may use for determining the ideal geographic range for foods imported to your area.</p><p>It is better not to import foods across the equator because atmospheric, oceanic, and electromagnetic conditions in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are opposite to one another. These differences also appear in the food products of each region and result in subtle, but opposite, effects on body and mind.</p><p>As mentioned previously, each person needs to eat according to his or her individual condition based on factors such as age, previous dietary history and tradition, activity, racial or cultural background, and physical constitution and condition. These modifications may appear in the types of grains, vegetables, and supplementary foods used, along with the way of cooking and combining food. Thousands of varieties of dishes are possible within the general principles presented above, and just a few of the many varieties of dishes used in macrobiotic cooking are included in this book.</p><p><b>Whole-Cereal Grains</b></p><p>Ideally, at least 50 percent of every macrobiotic meal will consist of cooked whole-cereal grain, prepared in a variety of ways. Whole organic cereal grains that are best for regular daily use include brown rice (short- and medium-grain brown rice), millet, barley (pearl and pearled) corn, whole oats, wheat berries, rye, and buckwheat. Other grains and grain products suitable for occasional use (once or twice a week) include sweet and long-grain brown rice, whole-wheat noodles (udon and somen), buckwheat noodles (soba), unleavened whole-wheat, whole-rye, or other whole-grain breads, rice cakes, cracked wheat, bulghur, steel-cut oats, rolled oats, cornmeal or grits, rye flakes, couscous, seitan, and fu. As you can see, whole grains are preferable to flour products. Flour products tend to be more difficult to digest.</p><p>Soups</p><p>You may consume approximately 5 percent (one or two cups) of your daily food in the form of miso or shoyu broth. The soup should not taste overly salty. Include a wide range of vegetables, especially wakame sea vegetable, every day. Grain and bean soups may also occasionally be eaten.</p>FOOD OR BEVERAGEIDEAL GEOGRAPHICAL RANGEWaterImmediate environment; ideally from a well or spring near your home.FruitSame climatic and geographical area; for example, the New England area for someone in Massachusetts.VegetablesMore extended area, but similar to the place in which you live; for example, the Mid-Atlantic or Midwestern states for someone in New England.Whole Grains and BeansFurther extended areas that share similar geographical and climatic conditions; for example, anywhere in North America for people living in the United States.Sea VegetablesEven further extended than the above; generally anywhere within the same climatic belt; for example, people living in North America or Europe may eat sea vegetables from either place or from the temperate zones of the Far East.Sea SaltThe entire hemisphere, either Northern or Southern, depending upon where you live.&nbsp;<br><p><b>Vegetables</b><br><br>About 25 to 30 percent of each macrobiotic meal may consist of vegetables. Two-thirds of these may be cooked in various styles (saut�ed, steamed, boiled, or baked). The remaining third may be eaten uncooked&#x2014;pressed in sea salt, umeboshi vinegar, or shoyu and water, pickled according to traditional methods, or prepared as raw salad. Enjoy the many kinds of vegetables that are available (green leafy, root, round, and ground vegetables) and learn to appreciate their different tastes, colors, and textures. Please note carefully the three lists below. Unless you live in a tropical climate, avoid the foods of tropical origin (listed in the last column) whenever possible, because they are difficult to balance in the body.</p>VegetablesREGULAR USEOCCASIONAL USEAVOID OR MODERATE USE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acorn squashalfalfa sproutsasparagusbok choychivesavocadobroccolicucumberbamboo shootsbroccoli rabeendivebeetsBrussels sproutsescaroleeggplantburdockgreen peasginsengbuttercup squashgreen snap (string) beansgreen and red peppersbutternut squashkohlrabi and greensJerusalem artichokescarrot topslettuceokracarrotsmung bean sproutspotatoescauliflowermushroomsspinachcelerypatty pan squashsweet potatoeschicoryred cabbageSwiss chardChinese cabbagerutabagataro (large ones)collard greensshiitake mushroomstomatoesdaikon, fresh or driedsnowpeasyamsdandelion greenssoybean sproutszucchinifresh cornsummer squashes&nbsp;garden or wintercresstaro (small ones)&nbsp;gingeryellow wax beans&nbsp;green cabbage&nbsp;&nbsp;Hokkaido pumpkin&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubbard squash&nbsp;&nbsp;kale&nbsp;&nbsp;leeks&nbsp;&nbsp;lotus root, fresh or dried&nbsp;&nbsp;lotus seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;mustard greens&nbsp;&nbsp;onions&nbsp;&nbsp;parsley&nbsp;&nbsp;parsnips&nbsp;&nbsp;pumpkin&nbsp;&nbsp;red radishes and greens&nbsp;&nbsp;scallions&nbsp;&nbsp;turnip greens&nbsp;&nbsp;turnips&nbsp;&nbsp;watercress&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><br><b>Beans and Sea Vegetables</b><br><br>About 5 to 10 percent of your daily diet may consist of cooked beans and sea vegetables. The most suitable beans for regular use are azuki beans, chick peas, and green lentils. Other beans that may be eaten on occasion include kidney beans, split peas, red lentils, navy beans, soybeans, turtle beans, Japanese black soybeans, pinto beans, and lima beans. Delicious bean products such as tempeh, natto, and fresh or dried tofu also may be enjoyed several times per week. Sea vegetables such as hiziki, arame, kombu, wakame, nori, green nori flakes, dulse, agar-agar, and kelp can be prepared in a variety of ways&#x2014;cooked with beans or vegetables, added to soups, or eaten separately as side dishes&#x2014;and flavored with a moderate amount of shoyu soy sauce, sea salt, or miso.<br><br><b>Supplementary Foods</b></p><p>This category may make up 5 to 10 percent of the overall food intake. The foods in this category include sweeteners, fruits, nuts, and beverages. They are optional in the sense that in some cases they may be included while in others they may need to be avoided. In general, those in good overall health may enjoy the supplementary items mentioned below. Persons with specific disorders are advised to seek the guidance of experienced macrobiotic friends or counselors regarding modifications of the standard diet.</p><p>Once or twice a week, a small amount of white-meat fish may be eaten if you desire and your present condition allows. Fruit desserts, as well as fresh and dried fruits (locally grown fruits only) may also be eaten on occasion. If you live in a temperate zone (most of the continental United States is temperate), avoid tropical and semitropical fruit. The use of fruit juice is not advisable. However, occasionally in warm weather it is all right, provided you are in good health.</p><p>Roasted seeds that have been lightly seasoned with tamari soy sauce may be enjoyed as a snack or supplement. These include squash, pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds.</p><p>Snacks such as rice cakes, puffed whole cereals, and popcorn may also be enjoyed from time to time, together with low-fat, northern varieties of nuts. Like seeds, nuts may be roasted in a skillet with a little tamari soy sauce.</p><p>Beverages. The beverages recommended for daily use include roasted bancha (kukicha) twig tea, roasted brown rice tea, toasted barley tea (mugicha), dandelion tea, and cereal grain coffee. Any traditional tea that does not have an aromatic fragrance or a stimulant effect may be used on the macrobiotic diet.</p>Sweeteners, Fruits, Seeds, and NutsOCCASIONAL USEVERY OCCASIONAL USEAVOID OR MODERATE USE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amazakealmondsbananasapple ciderfilbertsBrazil nutsapple juicelemonscashewsapples, fresh or driedpeanutscoconutsapricotspecansdatesbarley malttangerinesfigsblackberrieswalnutsgrapefruitsblueberries&nbsp;kiwicantaloupe&nbsp;mangoescherries&nbsp;orangeschestnuts&nbsp;papayasdried temperate-climate&nbsp;pistachiosfruits&nbsp;tangelosgrapes&nbsp;&nbsp;honeydew melon&nbsp;&nbsp;peaches&nbsp;&nbsp;pears&nbsp;&nbsp;plums&nbsp;&nbsp;prunes&nbsp;&nbsp;pumpkin seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;raisins&nbsp;&nbsp;raspberries&nbsp;&nbsp;rice syrup&nbsp;&nbsp;sesame seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;squash seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;strawberries&nbsp;&nbsp;sunflower seeds&nbsp;&nbsp;watermelon&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Condiments.

Practices such as keeping physically active and using natural cooking utensils, fabrics, and building materials in the home were once part of most people&#x2019;s daily lives. With each generation, we have gone further and further from our roots in nature, and have experienced a corresponding decline in vitality and a rise in chronic illness. The daily-life suggestions presented below complement a balanced, natural diet and can help to guide you toward more satisfying and harmonious living.</p><ul><li>Eat two to three times per day, making sure food proportions are correct and chewing is thorough. Avoid eating for approximately three hours before sleep. For thirst, in addition to the beverages listed above, an occasional sip of spring water, not iced, is okay.</li><li>Live each day happily, without being preoccupied with your health, and keep mentally and physically active.</li><li>Greet everyone and everything with gratitude, particularly offering thanks before and after each meal.</li><li>Chew your food very well, at least fifty times per mouthful.</li><li>Try to retire before midnight and get up early in the morning.</li><li>Avoid wearing synthetic clothing or woolen articles directly against your skin.

It is also the greatest masterpiece of Russian literature&#x2014;the source of the human archetypes and the attitudes that define and govern the towering fictional creations of nineteenth-century Russia&#x2014;and one of the most celebrated poems of the world. Before Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) wrote <i>Eugene Onegin,</i> his nation&#x2019;s literature was a parochial one; after he wrote it, due in no small part to its power and influence, the Russian tradition became one of the central traditions of Western civilization.</p><p>Alexander Pushkin&nbsp;(1799-1837) was a poet, playwright, and novelist who achieved literary prominence before he was twenty. His radical politics led to government censorship and periods of banishment from the capital, but he eventually married a popular society beauty and became a regular part of court life. Notoriously touchy about his honor, he died at age thirty-seven in a duel with his wife's alleged lover.</p><h2>Treasury of Smocking Designs (Dover Embroidery, Needlepoint)</h2><p><p>Smocking, the venerable English peasant craft dating from the late eighteenth century, was a needle technique originally used to adorn the traditional rural work chemise.

African American Studies. "A SWARM OF BEES IN HIGH COURT is, among other things, Tonya Foster's 'attempt to create biography of a place,' specifically Harlem in the 21st century, where certain dreams are indefinitely deferred. Foster's work is a poem of womanhood reminiscent of Gwendolyn Brooks' unassuming heroines Annie and Maud, Ntozake Shange declaring, 'I Usedta Live in the World,' or Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn singing 'Rocks in My Bed.' A sleepless woman with plenty of worrying thoughts to keep her up at night, not to mention chronic 'street corner noise,' lies at the heart of this work. From bedroom intimacies behind closed blinds to public displays of affection and disaffection, Foster's poetry contemplates unspoken bonds of culture, geography, and race that bring couples and communities together, along with the terrible strains that can tear them apart: 'this poem is the city of faces deserted by the hope of we.' Infused with a weary and wary blues, Tonya Foster's innovative variations on haiku are terse verses, tautly turned and tuned to cycles and rhythms of urban insomniacs."&#x2014;Harryette Mullen</p><p>Born in Bloomington, Illinois, Tonya M. Foster is more accurately a native of a home that no longer is what it was (as always), a home made less familiar by time, by water, by natural calamities and socially orchestrated disasters. Home = New Orleans, or rather N'Awlins&#x2014;that dike- enclosed fabrication caught among the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain, and the Gulf of Mexico, three tongues which should dictate the wills and ways of the city. Now residing in Harlem, she is a co-editor of <em>Third Mind: Creative Writing through Visual Art</em>, and a PhD candidate at the Graduate Center, CUNY, where she studies the poetics of place.</p><h2>The New Old Me: My Late-Life Reinvention</h2><p>&#x201c;A funny, seasoned take on dashed illusions.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;<b>O Magazine&nbsp;</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;I love everything Meredith Maran writes.

Not here, where the not-rich people go.</p><p>I decide against arguing with the security guard that I&#x2019;m both driver and patient, and therefore entitled to leave my car here while I drop myself off. I drive to the nearest garage, spin up and up and up the circular ramp, find a space on the fourth floor. I&#x2019;m too dizzy to search for the elevator. I get dizzier, trudging down the urine-soaked stairwell, right hand held high.</p><p>The ER doors slide open. I follow the receptionist&#x2019;s eyes to my right hand. Apparently the newspaper rule &#x201c;If it bleeds, it leads&#x201d; also applies here. She jumps up, rushes me into a treatment room, and runs out. A tall, balding doctor appears, snapping on gloves, and then a nurse, her hands already gloved. Neither of them makes eye contact with me. Neither of them says a word. The nurse lowers my hand from above my head, removes the dish towel, and deposits it in the hazardous waste bin. She lines the doctor&#x2019;s lap with blue-and-white Chux and sets my right hand into his upturned palm. His hand and the Chux turn red.</p><p>The doctor squints at my wedding ring. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll need to cut that off,&#x201d; he says.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; I say.</p><p>The doctor raises his eyebrows at me. I&#x2019;m sure he sees plenty of crazies in this ER; how would he know I&#x2019;m not one of them? Maybe I should tell him about the Dr. Phil moment I had yester- day, when I actually thought, It&#x2019;s time to move on with my life, and I looked at my wedding ring, wondering what it would feel like to take it off for the first time in a decade, to be me without it, without the story it used to tell, and then closed my eyes and pulled it off.</p><p>I put the ring in my underwear drawer and closed the drawer. I looked at my left hand without my ring on it and put the ring back on. I unhooked the gold chain around my neck and hung the ring on the chain and looked at my left hand without my ring on it and took the ring off the chain and put it back on my finger.</p><p>Problem identified. What I want is not to move on with my life. What I want is my old life back.</p><p>How long, I wondered, will it take me to stop wanting that? Will I be seventy, eighty, ninety, single and still wearing this wedding ring?</p><p>Baby steps, I told myself, and put the ring on my right hand instead of my left. It felt weird&#x2014;scary, sad&#x2014;but also accurate: not exactly married, not exactly not.</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t let you cut that ring off,&#x201d; I tell the doctor.</p><p>He frowns. The nurse whisks the bloody Chux off his lap and replaces them with a clean set.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you cut wedding rings off all the time,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;But my wife and I are separated. I&#x2019;m still hoping&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The doctor stares at me. There is a certain narrowing of his eyes, a certain clenching of his jaw. I realize that although it&#x2019;s 2012 and gay marriage is legal in seven states and we&#x2019;re in one of the world&#x2019;s gayest cities, this white-haired, white-faced man is not happy to be holding the hand of a woman who has a wife.</p><p>I watch as his conscience kicks in, or the diversity training the hospital made him take, or the nondiscrimination policies they require him to uphold. He reassembles his face. Too late. Message received.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been gay in America long enough to know Rule One: Physical Safety Above All. I don&#x2019;t want this guy to get sloppy on the job because he&#x2019;s sewing up a smartass, half-married, geriatric lesbian who doesn&#x2019;t even know which hand a wedding ring be- longs on.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to share any more of my innards with this doctor than the parts of me he&#x2019;s already holding. I won&#x2019;t tell him that until I got into my car and drove to Los Angeles three months ago, I thought I knew how the final phase of my life would go, and it didn&#x2019;t involve Los Angeles, let alone a solo trip to the Sunset Boulevard ER. I thought the choices I&#x2019;d made had set me up for a sweet ride the rest of the way.</p><p>Despite my boomer-appropriate countercultural predilections, I&#x2019;d turned out to be a fair to middling grown-up. I&#x2019;d sur- rounded myself with smart, loving people; saved money when I could and spent it frugally when I couldn&#x2019;t; worked hard at a career I loved and was good at; renovated a three-story Victorian on the Oakland/Berkeley border and lived there, while its value tri- pled, for twenty-three years.</p><p>Most auspiciously, I was ecstatically married. And I was sure I always would be.</p><p>&#x201c;Let me try to get it off myself,&#x201d; I tell the doctor.</p><p>He holds up my bleeding hand in the narrow space between our faces. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve cut yourself to the bone. If infection sets in, you could lose your finger. You could even go septic. Do you know what that means?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Let me try.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you fifteen minutes. Nurse Santos will help you.&#x201d; </p><p>The doctor beckons to the nurse and they both leave the room.</p><p>Nurse Santos returns with an armful of supplies. She sets a plastic bucket of ice, a giant tube of K-Y Jelly, and a pile of Chux on the tray in front of me. She plunges my finger into the bucket of ice, waits a few beats, pulls my finger out, slathers it with K-Y Jelly, and hands it back to me.</p><p>I close my eyes and I pull and twist and pull and twist. The ring is stuck. It&#x2019;s a vise grip tightening on my finger. It hurts like hell.</p><p>The doctor reappears. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;So. Which would you rather keep? Your finger or your wedding ring?&#x201d;</p><p>As he speaks, Nurse Santos gathers up what remains of our efforts and assembles a workstation on the rolling table: a neat row of syringes, scissors, thread, and some unrecognizable scary- looking instruments sealed in blue plastic bags.</p><p>The doctor reaches for my hand. I grab it back.</p><p>&#x201c;Any jeweler will be able to fix that ring,&#x201d; the nurse says.</p><p>The doctor rolls his shiny metal stool closer to me and grabs my right hand and shoves something cold and hard between my ring finger and my ring. I feel a sharp click. The nurse takes my hand before I can look at it. She sets a small plastic specimen jar next to me. The doctor&#x2019;s face floats near mine. He positions a syringe over my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;This will numb you,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll sew you up.&#x201d;</p><p>I turn away so I can&#x2019;t see what he&#x2019;s about to do. Instead my eyes turn to the specimen jar. In it, the broken circle of my wedding ring.</p></p><h2>The Assassination of Reinhard Heydrich</h2><p>On 4 June 1942 one of the most powerful figures of the Nazi regime died in agony from wounds sustained during an assassination attempt in Prague. This is the story of the killing of Reinhard Heydrich, a man of extraordinary intelligence, ruthlessness and ambition who had risen from obscurity to become head of the Nazi security police and Governor of Bohemia-Moravia. Regarded by many as Hitler&#x2019;s most likely successor, he was feared and hated even by other high-ranking Nazi officials.Heydrich&#x2019;s death caused shockwaves throughout the Nazi leadership, provoking ferocious reprisals against Czechs and Jews. Those who carried out the assassination were hunted down, and, trapped like rats in the cellar of a Prague church, committed suicide rather than face the certainty of torture and execution at the hands of the SS.Based on original archive material, interviews with surviving members of the Special Operations Executive, who trained the Czech assassins in the UK, and Czech military intelligence, Callum MacDonald&#x2019;s book is a well-researched and gripping account of one of the most audacious assassinations of the Second World War.</p><p>Before his death in 1996, Callum MacDonald was an historian at the University of Warwick. His publications include The Lost Battle: Crete, 1941, The United States, Britain and Appeasement and Korea: The War Before Vietnam, as well as numerous articles on appeasement and the origins of the Second World War.&#x2018;Excellent&#x2019; (Robert Kee <i>Observer</i>)<br><br>A nail-bitingly suspenseful account' (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Callum MacDonald has discovered much new material . . . and is an expert story-teller' (<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)</p><h2>Destroyer Captain: Lessons of a First Command</h2><p><p>This memoir of James Stavridis' two years in command of the destroyer USS <i>Barry</i> reveals the human side of what it is like to be in charge of a warship--for the first time and in the midst of international crisis. From Haiti to the Balkans to the Arabian Gulf&lt;, the <i>Barry</i> was involved in operations throughout the world during his 1993-1995 tour. Drawing on daily journals he kept for the entire period, the author reveals the complex nature of those deployments in a "real time" context and describes life on board the <i>Barry</i> and liberty ashore for sailors and officers alike.\\ With all the joy, doubt, self-examination, hope, and fear of a first command, he offers an honest examination of his experience from the bridge to help readers grasp the true nature of command at sea. The window he provides into the personal lives of the crew illuminates not only their hard work in a ship that spent more than 70 percent of its time underway, but also the sacrifices of their families ashore. Stavridis credits his able crew for the many awards the <i>Barry</i> won while he was captain, including the Battenberg Cup for top ship in the Atlantic Fleet. Naval aficionados who like seagoing fiction will be attracted to the book, as will those fascinated by life at sea. Officers from all the services, especially surface warfare naval officers aspiring to command, will find these lessons of a first command by one of the Navy's most respected admirals both entertaining and instructive.</p></p><p>Adm. James Stavridis, USN (Ret.) is a 1976 distinguished graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who spent over 35 years on active service in the Navy. He commanded destroyers and a carrier strike group in combat and served for seven years as a four-star admiral, including nearly four years as the first Navy officer chosen as Supreme Allied Commander for Global Operations at NATO. After retiring from the Navy he was named the dean of The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 2013. In addition, he currently serves as the U.S. Naval Institute's Chair of the Board of Directors. He has written articles on global security issues for <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Atlantic Magazine</i>, <i>Naval War College Review</i>, and <i>Proceedings</i> and is the author or co-author of several books, including <i>Command at Sea 6th Ed.</i> and <i>Destroyer Captain</i>."The window into the thoughts and feelings of one of the Navy's most successful officers of the era makes this a captivating read and is one of the most valuable aspects of the book. Every military officer and member of the joint and interagency warfighting team will gain precious insight into what it is really like commanding a U.S. Navy ship and leading sailors." -- <i><b>Joint Force Quarterly</b></i><br><br>"Designed to be a good read for anyone fascinated with what life is like behind the doors of the captain's cabin. Fortunately, Stavridis is a writer who is not only good with the small details of daily life but shares a sense of history and awe of the sea. Simply, he is in love with command at sea, and you feel it throughout the entire book." -- <i><b>Naval War College Review</b></i><br><br>"<i>Destroyer Captain</i> is a quick and enjoyable read. The writing flows like a good conversation with an old friend. This occurs in part because the chapters are short and succinct, enabling the reader to zip through the prose. Particularly valuable are transcripts of Stavridis' speeches to his crew on Memorial Day and during the Change of Command at the end of his tour...It is recommended for anyone who is interested in or has fond memories of naval service." -- <b>Naval Historical Foundation</b><br><br>"With all the joy, doubt, self-examination, hope, and fear of a first command, Stavridis offers an honest assessment of his experiences from the bridge to help readers grasp the true nature of command at sea.

In some ways I welcome the commotion; it keeps my mind from the object that lies hard by my lodgings here at the Blue Boar Inn in Salisbury. It is a scaffold, and I will be its first, and probably its last, occupant, for it has been built just for me. Such is the fate of a man who tries to take a king from his throne, and fails. </p> <p>Yet I do wish that things were more peaceful so I could better gather my thoughts, for what I say in the next world about my life will determine whether I am saved or damned. The best way to explain myself, I suppose, is to start at the beginning.</p> <p>People who knew all of us say-or said, for there are few of them alive now-that I favor my mother more than my father. I will have to take their word for it, for he died just a month or so after I turned three. I remember a man who bounced me on his shoulders and held me on his lap when I saw him, which was not all that often, and I remember the scar on his right hand, which I would trace wonderingly because it made the hand so different from my mother's, soft and white, and my nurse's, plump and scarred by nothing worse than years of honest labor.</p> <p>Father's scar was from the battle at St. Albans in May 1455. The battle had been a disastrous one for my family. My mother's father, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, had died there, and his eldest son, Henry, had been hauled away insensible in a cart, more dead than alive. My paternal grandfather, Humphrey, had had his face slashed, and my father too had been badly injured. Worse, the battle had left the Duke of York the ruler of England in all but name, and my family had fought for the House of Lancaster. All of this must have dispirited my parents, and I like to think I cheered them a little when I was born on the fourth day of September of that year and when I was named not Humphrey, the name my father and his father bore, but Henry, after the king for whom they had fought. I do hope indeed I cheered them, for in my eight-and-twenty years in this world I do not think I can say that I have done so for many people.</p> <p>In the fall of 1458, the pestilence, which in those days still swept through England regularly, paid one of its dreaded visits. It did what the Yorkists had failed to do-kill my father. As I was now the heir to the dukedom of my grandfather, he and my grandmother wished to take custody of me. So to their care I went, once the pestilence had stopped its raging and it was considered safe for me to travel. I was not much upset at the change. The two mainstays of my existence at that time were my nurse and my puppy, and both went with me.</p> <p>I came to know my grandfather somewhat better than I had my father, being more of an age now to observe what went on around me-and being doted on by my grandparents besides that. (Four of their seven sons had died young, my father had just died, and neither of my surviving uncles, Henry and John, had sons yet. I, therefore, was precious.) Grandfather, Humphrey Stafford, was a good man who tried to do what was best for England and to protect King Henry while trying to reach some sort of accord with the Duke of York. If only he had lived longer for me to profit by his example!</p> <p>As I settled into my new life with my grandparents, Fortune's Wheel, which had been spinning back and forth with regularity, spun in the direction of Lancaster. As a result, not long before the Christmas of 1459, visitors arrived at my grandparents' Essex manor of Writtle: Cecily Neville, Duchess of York, and her three youngest children, Margaret, George, and Richard. Cecily was my grandmother's younger sister. Needless to say, she and my Lancastrian grandmother had not been on the warmest of terms as of late, and though we politely referred to her and her children as our guests, it was no social visit the Duchess of York was paying now. The Duke of York was in exile, and his wife had been placed in my grandmother's custody at the order of King Henry.</p> <p>Since the youngest of the York children, Richard, has proven to be the death of me, I wish I could say there was a sense of doom from the first day of our meeting back at Writtle, but of course there wasn't. I was four at the time, just a month shy of being three years younger than Richard and nearly six years younger than George. My younger brother, Humphrey, who had been born shortly before my father died, was living with my mother. Thus, up until now there had been no other boys in the household except for pages, whose duties kept them to themselves. Naturally, I was delighted by this new company. I tagged along behind the York brothers, did my best to insinuate myself into their games, and tried with all my might to impress them. I am sure they regarded me as a thoroughgoing nuisance-and a Lancastrian nuisance at that. Probably I was an annoyance in another way as well. At the time, neither Richard nor George was a duke or a king's brother; they were simply two younger sons, far less important in the grand scheme of things than their father or their two older brothers, Edward and Edmund, both of whom were earls. Even at my young age, I, on the other hand, knew full well that I would be the next Duke of Buckingham, heir to one of the richest estates in the realm. I probably pointed this out more often than was strictly necessary.</p> <p>Yes, I must have been completely insufferable.</p></p><h2>Getting to Maybe: How the World Is Changed</h2><p><b>A practical, inspirational, revolutionary guide to social innovation</b><br><br> Many of us have a deep desire to make the world around us a better place. But often our good intentions are undermined by the fear that we are so insignificant in the big scheme of things that nothing we can do will actually help feed the world&#x2019;s hungry, fix the damage of a Hurricane Katrina or even get a healthy lunch program up and running in the local school. We tend to think that great social change is the province of heroes &#x2013; an intimidating view of reality that keeps ordinary people on the couch. But extraordinary leaders such as Gandhi and even unlikely social activists such as Bob Geldof most often see themselves as harnessing the forces around them, rather than singlehandedly setting those forces in motion. The trick in any great social project &#x2013; from the global fight against AIDS to working to eradicate poverty in a single Canadian city &#x2013; is to stop looking at the discrete elements and start trying to understand the complex relationships between them. By studying fascinating real-life examples of social change through this systems-and-relationships lens, the authors of <i>Getting to Maybe</i> tease out the rules of engagement between volunteers, leaders, organizations and circumstance &#x2013; between individuals and what Shakespeare called &#x201c;the tide in the affairs of men.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Getting to Maybe</i> applies the insights of complexity theory and harvests the experiences of a wide range of people and organizations &#x2013; including the ministers behind the Boston Miracle (and its aftermath); the Grameen Bank, in which one man&#x2019;s dream of micro-credit sparked a financial revolution for the world&#x2019;s poor; the efforts of a Canadian clothing designer to help transform the lives of Indigenous women and children; and many more &#x2013; to lay out a brand new way of thinking about making change in communities, in business, and in the world.</p><p><b>Frances Westley</b> has published widely in the areas of strategic change and visionary leadership, and led the Dupont Canada&#x2014;fostered think-tank on social innovation, based at McGill University&#x2019;s Desautel Faculty of Management, where many of the ideas for this book were developed. <br><br> <b>Brenda Zimmerman</b>, a professor at the Schulich School of Business at York University, has been studying and writing about how complexity theory applies to organizations for twenty years. <br><br> <b>Michael Quinn Patton</b> is an independent organizational development consultant and has written five major books on the art and science of program evaluation.Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? . . . Your playing small does not serve the world. There&#x2019;s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won&#x2019;t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. . . . It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates �others.<br><br>&#x2013;<b>Marianne Williamson,</b> <i>A Return to �Love</i><br><b>1. The First Light of Evening</b><br><br>From 1984 to the autumn of 1985, Bob Geldof, the lead singer of Irish rock band the Boomtown Rats, raised over sixty million pounds for famine relief in Ethiopia. He did it by organizing Band Aid, first cutting a �best-�selling song in collaboration with British rock stars and then organizing a huge Live Aid telethon, which lasted seventeen hours and was broadcast from both sides of the Atlantic. Geldof was seized with the determination to help the starving of Ethiopia while watching a BBC documentary on the famine. Hundreds of people were involved in making Live Aid successful, but the vision behind the effort was his. Live Aid not only set a standard for international rock concerts, but also tapped a new charitable �niche &#x2013; youth &#x2013; and challenged the aid delivery system set up by governments and �non-�governmental organizations (NGOs). Geldof worked out a strategy that allowed him to use the expertise and distribution systems of existing aid organizations while he cut through much of the red tape that traditionally slowed aid �delivery.<br><br>While Live Aid did not solve the problem of famine in Africa, Geldof was widely praised for his innovative contribution. He has been knighted, won numerous awards, and was nominated in 1986 for the Nobel Peace Prize. And yet, in many ways he was an unlikely hero. By his own admission, he was a marginally successful musician who had been leading a desolate life and making little effort to contribute to anything other than his musical career. He had been born poor and never received much of an education. As one journalist wrote, &#x201c;God opened the door and saw this scruffy Irishman and said, &#x2018;Oh what the heck, he&#x2019;ll do.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br><br>And he �did.<br><br>&#x2013;<br><br>In 1997, the World Bank reported that an estimated thirty million people had contracted HIV/AIDS and 90 percent of them were in developing countries. Statistics from the UN show this number had climbed to forty million by 2004 and is predicted to climb by another twenty million in the next two decades. Among those countries hardest hit is South Africa, which has the highest number of infected people of any country.<br><br>By any number of measures, Brazil should be at the top of the list with South Africa. In 1990, Brazil had almost twice as many cases of HIV/AIDS as South Africa, and a World Bank study predicted that Brazil would have �off-�the-�chart infection rates for HIV/AIDS by the turn of the millennium. The World Bank researchers told Brazil to focus on �prevention &#x2013; and in effect to be prepared to lose all those infected before the epidemic was under �control.<br><br>At the start of the new millennium, as predicted, one in four people in South Africa were infected with HIV. However, in Brazil, a miracle occurred: the country&#x2019;s infection rate had dropped to 0.6 percent (1 in 160). Today, Brazil is touted as a model for developing countries fighting HIV/AIDS. How did this miracle �happen?<br><br>If you look for a charismatic leader who inspired the people, you quickly realize there wasn&#x2019;t one. Instead, Brazilians at all levels, from government bureaucrats to local community leaders, joined forces in the service of a key guiding principle: no person, no matter how poor, insignificant or illiterate, could be written off as beyond cure. Liberation theology, a version of Catholicism that infuses Brazilian culture, proclaims the importance of empowering the poor and creating liberty for all. Health care workers looked for ways to ensure treatment would be available to all citizens regardless of their ability to pay and found resources that were hidden from external observers and HIV/AIDS experts. Volunteers from churches and other �non-�health charities worked alongside the clinical experts, and became invaluable in both helping people follow complicated drug regimens and learning ways to prevent infection. At the government level, a clause in an international trade agreement was used to wage a successful legal battle for the right to make generic drugs in cases of national emergency, which reduced the price of HIV/AIDS �drugs.<br><br>To spread the prevention message, the Brazilians decided to use humour rather than fear. Clowns wearing costumes made of condoms handed out condom lollipops to drive home the safe�sex message in a fun and memorable way. One playful billboard depicted three beautiful women sitting around a condom-shaped table. The thought bubbles above their heads all said &#x201c;Si.&#x201d; The message was that women will say yes, yes, yes to men who use condoms! These campaigns were in stark contrast to those in most other countries, which stressed &#x201c;Use condoms or you could die.&#x201d; Clearly Brazilians did not want anyone to die of AIDS. But they reasoned that youth, who were the most susceptible to contracting HIV, often feel invulnerable and rarely are thinking about death, especially when they are contemplating �sex.<br><br>&#x2013;<br><br>Live Aid is a miracle in �close-�up, which in our awestruck or inadequate moments we can put down to the actions of a �hero &#x2013; an individual larger than ourselves who is capable of changing the course of history. How, we wonder, could Bob Geldof have done this by himself? What was happening around him and to him that made such action possible? In his own words, &#x201c;Doors impenetrable a week earlier swung open effortlessly.&#x201d; Many of our good intentions seem to be smothered before we get off the couch. How were his efforts magnified and �amplified?</p><h2>Beautiful Mercy</h2><p>Giving and receiving mercy is central to living a life of passion and purpose.

She has a degree in fine arts and since college has studied everything from tap dancing to magic. When she isn&#x2019;t writing, reading or crocheting, she&#x2019;s probably at the gym.Chapter 1<br><br>"That yarn is going to choke me," Elise Belmont said, trying to pull the pink fibers off her tongue. More of them floated on the air, tickling the noses and sticking to the clothes of everyone in the vicinity of Adele Abrams.<br><br>"I don't know what you're fussing about," Adele said, holding up the piece on her long crochet hook. The move made more of the mohairlike fibers come loose, and they floated my way. Before I could swipe them from the air, they'd landed on my black sweater.<br><br>"I hope you're not using that yarn to teach the class," Mrs. Shedd told Adele. As an afterthought, she added, "You didn't buy it here, did you?" She looked at the rows of cubbies holding yarn in the back part of the bookstore.<br><br>Adele was befuddled by everyone attacking her yarn. "No, I'm not using it for the class, and no, I didn't get it here. It's just the perfect color for my honeymoon shrug," she said. She held it out to display the color, and the whole group of Tarzana Hookers tried to shield their faces from the onslaught of loose fibers. Adele looked at the label on the skein of yarn. "It's just a mixture of mohair and some other stuff. I might have bought it at Bargain Circus," she said offhandedly.<br><br>We were at one of what our crochet group, the Tarzana Hookers, called our happy hour get-togethers. Some people have a cocktail to release the tensions of the day-our group used crochet.<br><br>The conversation and friendship probably helped, too. The Tarzana part of our name referred to the San Fernando Valley community, where Shedd &amp; Royal Books and More was located. The bookstore where we met had a lot of space and had recently added a yarn department, which I was in charge of, along with my other duties as event coordinator and assistant manager.<br><br>Adele Abrams worked at the bookstore as well. She was in charge of the children's department. It hadn't been her choice. Really, Adele had wanted the position I'd gotten when I was first hired: event coordinator. She'd been given the children's department as a consolation prize.<br><br>Adele made an immediate segue from the honeymoon shrug to her upcoming wedding.<br><br>"Have I shown you the photos of the venue?" she asked. The group nodded while trying to hide that they were rolling their eyes. Adele produced the pictures on her phone anyway and showed them around.<br><br>"That's the lake, where you can have your ceremony on a barge." She waited until everyone acknowledged that they'd seen it. She flipped through the rest of them and showed off the rose garden with a gazebo for a ceremony, a small chapel, and several small outside areas. "That's the one Cutchykins and I are using," she said when she got to the last one. It featured an outdoor seating area on a slope that looked over the lake. I only hoped there wasn't going to be a barge wedding happening at the same time. Adele was busy pointing out the gazebo, which would be decorated with the bride's colors of choice. The reception was to be in a small cottage that was completely devoted to Adele's event.<br><br>I nudged my friend Dinah Lyons. "Why don't you reserve one of those spots? The barge might be nice." She knew I was joking and made a face at the ridiculousness of it.<br><br>"That kind of place isn't for Commander and me. I'm too old for that kind of showy stuff," she said. Dinah was somewhere in her fifties. She kept the exact number quiet, even from me. Commander was in the same age range-she was divorced and he was widowed. She'd been okay with keeping their relationship uncommitted, but he'd wanted it all to be proper and legitimate, so she'd finally agreed to become Mrs. Blaine.<br><br>"Hmm, two upcoming weddings," Rhoda Klein said, looking up from the doll she was making. "You do know they always say things go in threes."<br><br>When I looked up, the whole table was staring at me. "No way," I said. "I'm fine with things the way they are, and so is Mason." There was so much baggage that came with middle-aged dating. His kids, my kids. My late husband, his ex-wife. It was enough that we had decided to belong to each other, though I'm not even sure either of us knew what exactly that meant. I thought it was an adult version of going steady.<br><br>I brought up the schedule, glad to be able to change the subject. "Adele, it's time for your class."<br><br>Adele pursed her lips at me, no doubt annoyed that I'd spoken first. "Okay, put away your projects and make room for our new students." Adele began patrolling the table to make sure everyone did as she'd ordered.<br><br>We had tried putting on what we called Yarn University at the bookstore and it had been a tremendous success. Mrs. Shedd was always looking for new revenue streams, so had urged me to keep offering classes. Part of my duties as event coordinator slash head of the yarn department slash assistant manager was to run the classes. It made sense, since they were events at the bookstore.<br><br>The plan was to offer a new group of classes each month. The class about to begin was in Tunisian crochet. The technique produced stitches that had a different texture than regular crochet and almost resembled knitting. Adele began to lay out a selection of long hooks and hooks with cables attached as people began to come in.<br><br>My job was to be the greeter, so I stood at the entrance of the yarn department and checked people off as they arrived. There were going to be five of the Hookers and five outside students. CeeCee Collins came sailing across the bookstore first.<br><br>"Sorry I missed happy hour, dear," she said, giving me a hug. CeeCee was our resident celebrity. Her career had spanned decades and, until recently, she'd always been referred to as a veteran actress, which really meant old and on the back burner. But then CeeCee had gotten a supporting lead in Caught by a Kiss, a movie about a vampire who crocheted, and her new position was cemented when she was nominated for an Academy Award. CeeCee was self-absorbed, but at the same time she had an incredibly generous spirit.<br><br>She took an empty seat and folded her hands on the table like a polite student.<br><br>Our next arrival seemed a little prickly. When I asked her name, she leaned over and pointed to it on my clipboard with several rapid taps. "Susan Dryer," she said. She glanced over at the table with obvious disdain before asking where the instructor would be. When Adele waved her hand, Susan took the seat adjacent.<br><br>"Lauren Plimpton," the next arrival said. "My sister was going to come, too, but she flaked." I glanced up at her. She was dressed in comfortable jeans and a fuzzy gray hoodie. My immediate impression of her was that she was quiet and would be no trouble, which was good, since I'd already given the trouble spot to Susan. When Lauren was asked to tell us about herself, she hesitated before saying she was divorced with two kids and she'd learned how to crochet when she had to do a lot of waiting around, but gave no more details.<br><br>Susan didn't need an invitation to give us her bio. She assured us that she was a very experienced crocheter who could have taught herself Tunisian crochet, but she decided it would be interesting learning from a qualified instructor. "You are qualified?" Susan said, peering over her glasses at Adele.<br><br>Adele took the comment as a reproach, and I hastily stepped in. "I can assure you that Adele is an excellent instructor whose love of crochet is legendary." Susan made a noise like she wasn't completely satisfied with my answer.<br><br>"Well, then, let's get started," Susan said in a sharp voice. "And what's with all this pink fuzz?" She tried to brush some fibers off the sleeve of her dark green jacket.<br><br>"We're still waiting for a couple more students," I said. "Sorry about the fibers." I tried to brush them off the table, but they floated up into the air.<br><br>I sighed. On top of dealing with the annoying fibers and surly students, today was my birthday, and nobody had remembered other than my best friend. I had been trying to hide my disappointment, but Dinah picked up on the slight pout my mouth had slipped into. "We'll celebrate after class," she assured me. "Le Grande Fromage, my treat."<br><br>"I can't believe everybody forgot," I said, glancing over the group. It wasn't like it was just any birthday. It was the big five-oh. "Well, Mason sent me flowers and a sweet note apologizing again for having to be out of town. And my parents called from Santa Fe."<br><br>Adele gave me a sharp look and spoke under her breath. "What's your problem, Pink? You seem out of sorts. We don't want you bringing everybody down."<br><br>Having her call me by my last name used to bother me-she'd started doing it to annoy me because I'd gotten the event coordinator position over her so long ago. But by now I was sure it was just habit and she didn't even remember why she did it. "You want to know why I seem upset?" I started, all set to tell the truth. I was shocked when Dinah just about physically pushed me out of the way and spoke for me.<br><br>"Molly is just bummed out about the huge house going up behind hers. The yard isn't even finished, but somebody has already moved in," Dinah said. I didn't know why she'd stopped me from mentioning my birthday, but I let it go, because just then two more students arrived.<br><br>They came in together, and I understood their situation right away. They were actually touching arms as they got to the table. It didn't matter that they introduced themselves separately as Terri and Melody-they were like one unit. Naturally, they chose seats next to each other.<br><br>The last arrival was a lone woman with a small dog in one of those dog strollers. Her name was Fanny and the dog's name was Oscar. Susan looked at both of them. "Oh, puleeze," she said with an annoyed roll of her eyes. "Can we get started now?" Susan asked in an even sharper voice. Adele nodded and began her spiel.<br><br>The first class was really just an introduction and a chance for everyone to learn the basic afghan stitch and get their supplies. I spent most of it helping everyone get their specialized hooks and yarn. When the class broke up, we had all made several swatches and were comfortable with the new technique.<br><br>"Who would have expected Adele to be such a good teacher?" Dinah said as we went down the street to the French bistro. It was a beautiful day out-the April weather in Southern California could be all over the place, but usually most of the rain was over for the year and the temperatures were milder.<br><br>"As long as she's only dealing with crochet," I countered. The Tarzana Hookers all thought crochet was the superior yarn craft, but Adele took it to an extreme. That's why I ended up in charge of the yarn department and Yarn University. Mrs. Shedd insisted that we include knitting supplies and classes, and Adele simply couldn't handle that.<br><br>I appreciated Dinah's attempt at celebrating my birthday, and I suppose I should have been grateful the counter guy didn't stick a candle in my croissant and sing "Happy Birthday," but it was still pretty depressing. The place was about to close, and we were the only customers.<br><br>Dinah offered to come home with me, but I said I'd be fine. I was already planning to make a bowl of caramel corn and watch a double feature from my collection of favorite comedies.<br><br>I knew there was something wrong as soon as I went through my back gate. The dogs were loose in the yard and Cosmo, Felix and Blondie all ran up to me. I turned on the floodlights that illuminated the yard, from the garage. When I got close to the back door, I saw it was ajar. It was dark inside, but my house wasn't supposed to be dark-I had timers set to turn on the lights.<br><br>I pulled out my phone, considering calling 911, but what was I going to say? Still, I hesitated about going inside. Finally, I stepped close to the open door and listened, but heard nothing. I decided to call my son Samuel's cell phone and tell him the situation.<br><br>"Sorry, Mom," he said, "I must have forgotten to lock the door and the dogs must have opened it." Samuel was in his twenties and lived with me. I was going to say something about responsibility and bring up the lights being off, but before I could he had hung up.<br><br>I let out a sigh and went inside. I was feeling the wall for the kitchen light when something touched my hand. I automatically recoiled and made a move toward the back door, but the lights came on and there was a burst of noise.<br><br>"Surprise!" a chorus of voices said. I was sprinkled with confetti and streamers and saw that a bunch of Mylar balloons that said "Happy Birthday" were stuck to the ceiling.<br><br>Samuel came out of the crowd with a grin. "Fooled you, didn't we?" Mason Fields was just behind him. He gave me a big hug and handed me a glass of champagne.<br><br>I was mumbling something about his flowers and his being out of town. I was more than a little stunned. Dinah came in through the back door.<br><br>"Now you understand why I shushed you when you were going to grumble about your birthday," she said.<br><br>"Thank you for keeping me from making a fool of myself," I said, seeing that Adele and her fianc&#x17d; were part of the crowd.<br><br>My mother pushed through. She started to wish me a happy fiftieth, but stopped herself. "If you're that old, what will people think I am?"<br><br>The Hookers were there, along with Mrs. Shedd and her partner, Mr. Royal. My older son, Peter, was in the group, too, giving his usual look of disapproval.<br><br>Mason and Samuel high-fived each other as they told me they'd planned the whole thing, then led me into the dining room. The table was laden with deli platters, and there was a triple berry cake from my favorite bakery. It was all a bit of a blur as I greeted everybody and accepted their good wishes.<br><br>Boy, did I ever feel guilty for all my bad thoughts that everyone had forgotten my birthday.</p><h2>Mastery Through Accomplishment</h2><p>Accomplishment in worldly affairs is seen as the means of developing the ability to achieve what one wishes, and ultimately to achieve the purpose of life.</p><p>Hazrat Inayat Kahn, founder of the Sufi order in the West, was born in India in 1882.

She argues for the importance of recognizing&#x2014;and archiving&#x2014;accounts of trauma that belong as much to the ordinary and everyday as to the domain of catastrophe. <i>An Archive of Feelings </i>contends that the field of trauma studies, limited by too strict a division between the public and the private, has overlooked the experiences of women and queers. Rejecting the pathologizing understandings of trauma that permeate medical and clinical discourses on the subject, Cvetkovich develops instead a sex-positive approach missing even from most feminist work on trauma.<i> </i>She challenges the field to engage more fully with sexual trauma and the wide range of feelings in its vicinity, including those associated with butch-femme sex and aids activism and caretaking.&nbsp;<p></p><p><i>An Archive of Feelings </i>brings together oral histories from lesbian activists involved in act up/New York; readings of literature by Dorothy Allison, Leslie Feinberg, Cherr�e Moraga, and Shani Mootoo; videos by Jean Carlomusto and Pratibha Parmar; and performances by Lisa Kron, Carmelita Tropicana, and the bands<i> </i>Le Tigre and<i> </i>Tribe 8. Cvetkovich reveals how activism, performance, and literature give rise to public cultures that work through trauma and transform the conditions producing it. By looking closely at connections between sexuality, trauma, and the creation of lesbian public cultures, Cvetkovich makes those experiences that have been pushed to the peripheries of trauma culture the defining principles of a new construction of sexual trauma&#x2014;one in which trauma catalyzes the creation of cultural archives and political communities. <br></p></p><p>&#34;&#34;An Archive of Feelings&#34; makes an extremely important contribution to queer and feminist cultural studies by insisting upon the public, and indeed national, dimensions of sexual trauma. Ann Cvetkovich&#39;s book argues for the productive rather than repressive power of trauma and accounts for its role in the production of queer identities and queer counter publics. This is queer cultural studies at its finest!&#34;--Judith Halberstam, author of &#34;Female Masculinity&#34;<p>Ann Cvetkovich is Associate Professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin.

In his living memory, Suzuki has witnessed cataclysmic changes in society and our relationship with the planet: the doubling of the world&#x2019;s population, our increased ecological footprint, and massive technological growth. Today we are in a state of crisis, and we must join together to respond to that crisis. If we do so, Suzuki envisions a future in which we understand that we are the Earth and live accordingly. All it takes is imagination and a determination to live within our, and the planet's, means. This book is the culmination of David Suzuki&#x2019;s amazing life and all of his knowledge, experience, and passion it is his legacy.</p><p><p><strong>David Suzuki</strong> is an internationally renowned geneticist and environmentalist and a recipient of UNESCO&#x2019;s Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science and the 2009 Right Livelihood Award. Host of the longrunning CBC television program <em>The Nature of Things</em>, he is also the author of more than fifty books.</p> <p><b>Margaret Atwood</b> was born in 1939 in Ottawa and grew up in northern Ontario, Quebec, and Toronto. Throughout her writing career, she has received numerous awards and honourary degrees. Atwood is the author of more than thirty-five volumes of poetry, children's literature, fiction, and non-fiction and is perhaps best known for her novels, which include <i>The Edible Woman</i>,<i> The Handmaid's Tale</i>, <i>The Robber Bride</i>, <i>Alias Grace</i>, and <i>The Blind Assassin</i>, which won the prestigious Booker Prize in 2000. Margaret Atwood currently lives in Toronto with writer Graeme Gibson, with whom she is the Joint Honourary President of the Rare Bird Society within BirdLife International.</p><b>Foreword, by Margaret Atwood</b><br><br>What you&#x2019;re about to read is David Suzuki&#x2019;s Legacy Lecture. The term legacy&#x201d; has an ominous ring to it, a hint of departure: surely he isn&#x2019;t going somewhere? Not so soon! He&#x2019;s a landmark! No other living Canadian has done so much nationally and internationally to make us aware of the world we live in and of its precarious state. And no one else started this task so early and has taken so much flak for it.<br><br>It seems that David Suzuki has always been with us. He&#x2019;s lived in the tradition of the great prophets those whose messages go unheeded because they tell us things we find uncomfortable. Time after time he&#x2019;s gone up the sacred mountain, listened to the voice, understood that it is what it is, and brought the hard but true words back down, only to find us cavorting around shiny gods of our own devising. He&#x2019;s been doing that in so many ways, over so many days on Quirks and Quarks, a radio science program he started; on CBC television&#x2019;s The Nature of Things, which he&#x2019;s hosted since 1972; and through the David Suzuki Foundation, dedicated to making the world a sustainable place. It&#x2019;s a wonder he never gave up on us. But he didn&#x2019;t: after each potato flung his way, he trudged up the mountain again, rearranged the words to make them more understandable, and gave us another try.<br><br>As for his somewhat dire reputation Dr. Doom and Gloom,&#x201d; as he himself tells us let&#x2019;s consider the deeper meaning of the word legacy.&#x201d; A legacy is something you pass on, and it assumes there will be someone to pass it on to. That&#x2019;s quite a leap of faith for Dr. Suzuki, considering the grisly facts he&#x2019;s been facing. But as you&#x2019;ll see, he makes the leap. Human intelligence and foresight got us into our present pickle by enabling us to invent such efficient ways of exploiting Nature that our population growth went into overdrive, and now human intelligence and foresight are all we can rely on to see us through the tight bottleneck we&#x2019;re fast approaching that narrowing chasm where far too many people are faced with far too little food and, very possibly, far too little air.<br><br>But, says Suzuki, we can do it if we really try, and we really will try if we can visualize the danger we&#x2019;re in. Programmed as we are to grasp the low-hanging fruit, enjoy the present hour at the expense of the years to come, and ignore the storm until it&#x2019;s almost upon us, we do have the capacity to learn from experience and to look ahead.<br><br>David Suzuki is by training a biologist a scientist which to some people conjures up the image of a white-coated rationalist, devoid of emotion and bent on pure experiment. But no human being is really like that, not even economists. Neurologists tell us that purely rational thinking is an impossibility for us: instead we think-feel; we feel-think. David Suzuki came to biology the way so many have: through the emotions, a love of the natural world the world he then set out to explore using his intelligence. What he did with the love and the intelligence is a thing the human race has been doing to its advantage ever since the Pleistocene: he told stories about what he loved and what he discovered, stories that confer a benefit on those who hear them if only they will listen with care.<br><br>The legacy&#x201d; in this lecture is one of truthful words about the hard place we&#x2019;re in, but it&#x2019;s also one of hopeful words: our chance if we will take it for opportunity, beauty, wonder, and companionship with the rest of creation.&#x201d; My own hope is that we ourselves will emulate David Suzuki and leave legacies in our turn, and that the planet will through our efforts become a better and more liveable home than the rapidly deteriorating biosphere we find ourselves in right now.

Western scholars and interpreters of the dakini, influenced by Jungian psychology and feminist goddess theology, have shaped a contemporary critique of Tibetan Buddhism in which the dakini is seen as a psychological "shadow," a feminine savior, or an objectified product of patriarchal fantasy. According to Judith Simmer-Brown--who writes from the point of view of an experienced practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism--such interpretations are inadequate. <br>In the spiritual journey of the meditator, Simmer-Brown demonstrates, the dakini symbolizes levels of personal realization: the sacredness of the body, both female and male; the profound meeting point of body and mind in meditation; the visionary realm of ritual practice; and the empty, spacious qualities of mind itself. When the meditator encounters the dakini, living spiritual experience is activated in a nonconceptual manner by her direct gaze, her radiant body, and her compassionate revelation of reality. Grounded in the author's personal encounter with the dakini, this unique study will appeal to both male and female spiritual seekers interested in goddess worship, women's spirituality, and the tantric tradition.Judith Simmer-Brown, Ph.D., is professor and chair of the religious studies department at Naropa University (formerly the Naropa Institute), where she has taught since 1978. She has authored numerous articles on Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and Buddhism in America. She is an Acharya (senior teacher) in the lineage of Ch�gyam Trungpa. A practicing Buddhist since 1971, she lives in Boulder, Colorado.</p><h2>The Forgotten Peninsula: A Naturalist in Baja California</h2><p>"The author deftly weaves the materials of natural and human history into a radiant, tightly woven fabric. . . .

Mari had grown up in tiny Welsh fishing village where she lived alone with her father, Daffyd, a master fisherman&#x2014;her mother and brother having drowned when she was a child. Mari had long ago given up trying to talk to her father about the creatures she saw. <br> &nbsp;<br> But on the morning of her eighteenth birthday, her father finally told her the great secret of the Prothero family. Her family had an ancient covenant with magical shape-shifters, the Selch, who were half-human, half-seal people. Her lost mother and brother were not truly dead, but neither were they human. Now Mari must abide by her family&#x2019;s magical compact, or face dire consequences. <br> &nbsp;<br> But Mari was not without protectors. The tiny creatures she had seen her whole life counseled her to bargain with the Selch.

Born and raised in north London, she lives there still with her husband and children.</p>Jewell's boisterous sixth novel is a compulsively readable jaunt through the lives of a handful of suburban London misfits. Leah, a shopgirl whose live-in boyfriend flees when she mentions marriage, lives across the street from Toby, a struggling poet who lets out rooms in his bedraggled Victorian house to ragtag tenants who pay rent when they remember and clutter up his otherwise solitary life. There's a cabaret singer who depends on sugar daddies to keep afloat; a mailroom clerk who shares a room with his mother; and a stylish recluse. And then there's longtime tenant Gus, whom Leah finds dead on the front walk one day. When Toby discovers that Gus has willed him a sickly cat and a pile of pounds with the provision that Toby use the money to make his life everything it could be, it provides the impetus for a shakeup at Toby's that sends the cast in different directions as they each find ways to grow up. Jewell (<i>Vince and Joy</i>) has a sure hand with the lightly humorous and romantic, and she delivers the goods: an eccentric cast, lively banter and plenty of warmhearted cheer. <i>(Mar.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He crouched on the edge of the opened grave, fighting off a vague urge to jump down into it.<br><br>Looks cozy down there. Out of the wind, dark and warm . . . <br><br>He rubbed at his unshaven chin instead. Three days of stubble, rasping on calloused fingers, itching on hollow cheeks. His cloak, puddled about him where he crouched, was soiled at the border and soaking up water from the rain-�drenched grass. The shoulder of his sword arm nagged from the unrelenting damp.<br><br>He shut out the ache and brooded on what lay below him in the grave.<br><br>They&#x2019;d come a long way for this.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t much&#x2014;�shards of wood that might once have formed a casket, a few long strips of leather, cured stiff and crumbling. A mess of small bone fragments, like the leavings of some overenthusiastic soothsayer on the scry . . . <br><br>Gil sighed and levered himself back to his feet. Tossed the jawbone back in with the rest.<br><br>&#x201c;Fucking waste of five months.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My lord?&#x201d;<br><br>Shahn, the marine sergeant, who&#x2019;d climbed back out of the grave and now waited close by the mounds of earth his men had dug out. Behind him, the work party stood around, soil-� and sweat-�streaked, entrenching tools in hand, scowling against the weather. Whoever dug this plot all those centuries ago, they&#x2019;d chosen a spot close to the cliffs, and right now there was a blustery wind coming in off the ocean, laced with fistfuls of sleet and the promise of another storm. The three Hironish guides they&#x2019;d hired back in Ornley already had their hoods up&#x2014;�they stood farther from the grave, watching the sky and conversing in low tones.<br><br>Ringil brushed the traces of dirt off his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all done here,&#x201d; he announced loudly. &#x201c;If this is the Illwrack Changeling, the worms sorted him out for us awhile back. Stow tools, let&#x2019;s get back to the boats.&#x201d;<br><br>A tremor of hesitation&#x2014;�hands working at tool handles, feet shifting. The sergeant cleared his throat. Gestured halfheartedly at the soft-�mounded earth beside the grave.<br><br>&#x201c;Sire, should we not . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fill that in?&#x201d; Ringil grinned harshly. &#x201c;Listen, if those bones stand up and follow us down to the beach, I&#x2019;ll be very surprised. But you know what&#x2014;�if they do, I&#x2019;ll deal with it.&#x201d;<br><br>His words carved out their own patch of quiet in the rising wind. Among the men, a touching of talismans. Some muttering.<br><br>Ringil cut them a surreptitious glance, counting faces without seeming to. A couple of those he saw had been around when he took down the kraken, but most were on the other ships at the time; or they were aboard Dragon&#x2019;s Demise but in their bunks. It had been a filthy night anyway&#x2014;�rain and howling wind, bandlight muffled up in thick, scudding cloud, and the encounter was over almost as soon as it began. All but a handful missed the action.<br><br>They had reports from their comrades, of course, but Ringil couldn&#x2019;t blame them for doubting it. Killing a kraken, at the height and heart of an ocean storm by night&#x2014;�yeah, right. It was a stock scene out of myth, a lantern-�light story to frighten the cabin boy with. It was a fucking tale.<br><br>It was five weeks now, and no one was calling him Krakenbane that he&#x2019;d noticed.<br><br>He supposed it was for the best. He&#x2019;d held enough commands in the past to know how it went. Best not to disabuse your men of their tight-�held notions, whatever those might be. That went in equal measure for those who doubted him and those who told tales of his prowess. The actual truth would probably scare both parties out of their wits, and that, right here and now, was going to be counterproductive.<br><br>They were twitchy enough as it was.<br><br>He faced them. Put one booted foot on the forlorn, shin-�high chunk of mossed-�over granite that served the grave as marker. He pitched his voice for them all to hear&#x2014;�pearls of dark wisdom from the swordsman sorcerer in your midst.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, people, listen up. Anyone wants to sprinkle salt, go right ahead, get it done. But if we stay here to fill this hole in, we&#x2019;re going to get drenched.&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded westward, out to sea. It was not long past noon, but the sour afternoon light was already closing down. Clouds raced in from the north, boiling up like ink poured in a glass of water. Overhead, the sky was turning the black of a hanged man&#x2019;s face.<br><br>Yeah&#x2014;�be calling that an omen before you know it.<br><br>His mood didn&#x2019;t improve much on the way back to the boats. He took point on the meandering sheep track that brought them down off the cliffs. Set a punishing pace over the yielding, peaty ground. No one made the mistake of trying to stay abreast or talk to him.<br><br>By way of contrast, there was raucous good cheer at his back. The marines had loosened up with the permission to lay wards. Now they tramped boisterously along behind him, good-�natured bickering and jeering in the ranks. It was as if they&#x2019;d poured out their misgivings with the salt from their tooled leather bags, left it all behind them in the tiny white traceries they&#x2019;d made.<br><br>Which, Ringil supposed, they had, and wasn&#x2019;t that the whole point of religion anyway?<br><br>But he was honest enough to recognize his own released tension as well. Because, despite all the other pointless, empty graves, despite his own increasingly solid conviction that they were wasting their time, he, too, had gone up to those cliffs expecting a fight.<br><br>Wanting a fight.<br><br>Little vestiges of the feeling still quivered at the nape of his neck and in his hands. Enough to know it had been there, even if he hadn&#x2019;t spotted it at the time.<br><br>Last resting place of the Illwrack Changeling.<br><br>Again.<br><br>This being the ninth last resting place to date. The ninth grave of the legendary Dark King they&#x2019;d dug up, only to find the detritus of common mortality beneath.<br><br>Has to be an easier way to do this shit.<br><br>Really, though, there wasn&#x2019;t, and he knew it. They were all strangers here, himself included. Oh, he&#x2019;d read about the Hironish isles in his father&#x2019;s library as a boy, learned the arid almanac facts from his tutors. And growing up in Trelayne he&#x2019;d known a handful of people who&#x2019;d spent time there in exile. But this was not knowledge with practical application, and anyway it was decades out of date. Fluent Naomic aside, he had no useful advantage over his fellow expedition members.<br><br>Meanwhile, Anasharal the Helmsman, full of ancient unhuman knowing when they planned the expedition back in Yhelteth last year, was now proving remarkably cagey about specifics. The Kiriath demon was either unwilling or unable to point them with any clarity to the Changeling&#x2019;s grave, and instead suggested&#x2014;�somewhat haughtily&#x2014;�that they do the legwork themselves and inquire of the locals. I fell from on high for your benefit, went the habitual gist of the lecture. Is it my fault that I no longer have the vision I gave up in order to bring my message to you? I have steered you to journey&#x2019;s end. Let human tongues do the rest.<br><br>But the Hironish islanders were a notoriously closed-�mouth bunch&#x2014;�even Gil&#x2019;s dull-�as-�dishwater tutors had mentioned that. Historically, they&#x2019;d been know to harbor popular pirates and tax evaders despite anything the League&#x2019;s heavy-�handed customs officers could do about it. To lie with impassive calm in the face of threats, to spit with contempt at drawn steel, and to die under torture rather than give up a fellow islander.<br><br>So they certainly weren&#x2019;t about to spill the secrets of settled generations to some bunch of poncey imperials who showed up from the alien south and started asking oh, hey, we hear there&#x2019;s this dark lord out of legend buried around here somewhere. Any chance you could take us to him?<br><br>Not just like that, anyway.<br><br>It took a week of careful diplomacy in and out of the taverns in Ornley and then out to the hamlets and crofts beyond, just to find a handful of locals who would talk to them. It took soft words and coin and endless rounds of drinks. And even then, what these men had to say was sparse and contradictory:<br><br>&#x2014;�the Illwrack Changeling, hmm, yes, that&#x2019;d be the one from the dwenda legend. But he was never buried up here, the dwenda took him away in a shining longship, to where the band meets the ocean . . . <br><br>&#x2014;�crucified him on Sirk beach for a betrayer, was what I heard, facing the setting sun as he died. His followers took him down three days later and buried him. It&#x2019;s that grave up behind the old whaler&#x2019;s temple.<br><br>&#x2014;�the Illwrack Betrayer was brought to the Last Isle, to the Chain&#x2019;s Last Link, just as the legends say. But the isle only manifests to mortal eyes at spring solstice, and even then, only with much purifying prayer. To land there would require an act of great piety. You should ask at the monastery on Glin cliffs, perhaps they can make offerings for you when you return next year.<br><br>Yeah, that&#x2019;s right&#x2014;�jeers from farther down the tavern bar&#x2014;�you should ask his brother out at Glin. Never known him turn down a request for intercession if it came weighted with enough coin . . . <br><br>You know, I&#x2019;ve had about enough out of you whelps. My brother&#x2019;s a righteous man, not like some worthless bastard sons I could&#x2014;�<br><br>They&#x2019;d had to break that one up with fists. Start all over again.<br><br>&#x2014;�the grave you seek is on a promontory of the Grey Gull peninsula, no more than a day&#x2019;s march north of here. On approach, Grey Gull may seem a separate island, but do not be deceived. Certain currents cause the inlets to fill enough at certain times to make it so&#x2014;�but you can always cross, at worst you might have to wade waist deep. And most of the time, you won&#x2019;t even get your boots wet.<br><br>Hagh!&#x2014;�a graybeard fishing skipper hawks and spits something unpleasantly yellow onto the tavern&#x2019;s sawdust floor, rather close to Ringil&#x2019;s boot&#x2014;�not going to find that grave this side of hell! That&#x2019;s where the Aldrain demons took that one&#x2014;�screaming to hell!<br><br>No, no, my lords, forgive him, this is just fisherfolk superstition. The last human son of Illwrack is buried at the compass crossroads, on a rise just south of here. Some say the hill itself is the Changeling&#x2019;s barrow.<br><br>&#x2014;�the truth, my lords, is that the dwenda hero was laid to rest in the stone circle at Selkin, where his retainers . . . <br><br>So forth.<br><br>It was a lot of digging.<br><br>But in the absence of the imperial expedition&#x2019;s other main prize&#x2014;�the legendary floating city of An-�Kirilnar, which they also couldn&#x2019;t seem to find right now&#x2014;�there really wasn&#x2019;t much else to do but tramp out to site after site and dig until disappointed.<br><br>Disappointment is a slow poison.<br><br>Initially, and for some of the closer sites, practically every figure of note on the expedition tagged along. There was still a palpable air of journey&#x2019;s end hanging over them all at that point&#x2014;�a sense that after all that planning, all those sea miles covered, this was it. And whatever it was, no one wanted to miss it.<br><br>True above all for Mahmal Shanta&#x2014;�he went out of sheer academic curiosity and at the cost of some substantial personal discomfort. Really too old for a voyage into such cold climes anyway, Shanta was still getting over flu and had to be carried on a covered litter by six servants, which was awkward over rough ground and slowed everybody else down. Gil rolled his eyes at Archeth, but in the end what were you going to do? The naval engineer was a primary sponsor of the expedition; his family&#x2019;s shipyards had built two of the three vessels they sailed in and reconditioned the third, and even in illness he held onto a stubborn and canny command of the flagship Pride of Yhelteth.<br><br>If anyone had earned the right, it was Shanta.<br><br>Archeth&#x2019;s reasons for riding along were twofold, and a little more pragmatic. She went because she was overall expedition leader and it was expected of her. But more than that, she badly needed something to take her mind off the lack of any Kiriath architecture standing above the waves offshore. Not finding An-�Kirilnar had hit her hard.<br><br>Marine commander Senger Hald went ostensibly to supervise those of his men detailed to the search, but really to put an unquestionable marine boot on the proceedings. And Noyal Rakan went beside him, to show the Throne Eternal flag and remind everyone who was supposed to be in charge. The two men were coolly amicable, but the interservice rivalry was never far beneath the surface, in them or in the men they commanded.<br><br>Lal Nyanar, captain of Dragon&#x2019;s Demise mostly on account of Shab Nyanar&#x2019;s substantial investment in the expedition, went along even when the prospecting was done overland, apparently out of some belief that he was representing his absent father&#x2019;s interests in the quest. Gil didn&#x2019;t really begrudge him; Nyanar wasn&#x2019;t much of a sea captain&#x2014;�the sinecure commands his father had secured for him back in Yhelteth were largely ceremonial or involved river vessels&#x2014;�but he did at least know how to follow orders. Out of sight of his ship, he deferred to the expedition leaders and kept his head down.<br><br>The same could not be said of the others.<br><br>Of the expedition&#x2019;s other investors who&#x2019;d actually made the trip north, Klarn Shendanak stuck close to the action because he didn&#x2019;t trust Empire men any further than you could throw one, and that included Archeth Indamaninarmal, jet-�skinned half-�human imperial cypher that she was. Menith Tand followed suit and stuck close to Shendanak because he harbored a standard Empire nobleman&#x2019;s distaste for the Majak&#x2019;s rough-�and-�ready immigrant manners and would not be one-�upped. And Yilmar Kaptal went along because he mistrusted both Shendanak and Tand in about equal measure. The three of them didn&#x2019;t quite spit at each other outright, but having them at your back was like leading a procession of alley cats. Shendanak never went anywhere without an eight-�strong honor guard of thuggish-�looking second cousins fresh down from the steppes, which in turn meant that Tand brought along a handful of his own mercenary crew to balance the equation, and Kaptal flat-�out demanded that Rakan muster a squad of Throne Eternal just in case . . . <br><br>Egar usually tagged along at Gil&#x2019;s shoulder just to see if there&#x2019;d be any kind of fight.</p><h2>Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English (Wesleyan Poetry Series)</h2><p>In recent years, the ghazal (pronounced &#34;ghuzzle&#34;), a traditional Arabic form of poetry, has become popular among contemporary English language poets. But like the haiku before it, the ghazal has been widely misunderstood and thus most English ghazals have been far from the mark in both letter and spirit. This anthology brings together ghazals by a rich gathering of 107 poets including Diane Ackerman, John Hollander, W. S. Merwin, William Matthews, Paul Muldoon, Ellen Bryant Voigt, and many others. As this dazzling collection shows, the intricate and self-reflexive ghazal brings the writer a unique set of challenges and opportunities. Agha Shahid Ali&#39;s lively introduction gives a brief history of the ghazal and instructions on how to compose one in English. An elegant afterword by Sarah Suleri Goodyear elucidates the larger issues of cultural translation and authenticity inherent in writing in a &#34;borrowed&#34; form.</p><p>6 x 9 trim. LC 00-009342"This anthology introduces a genuinely original note into the American publishing scene -- ludic, accomplished, intriguing. It could well launch a new fad. No one could be a better guide to the ghazal in English than Ali, a poet from Kashmir who writes with equal facility in Urdu and English." -- Edmund White <p>"Reading this anthology straight through is a fascinating experience -- what a range of voice and subjects the editor has coaxed into creating 'cultural transitions.' It is indeed a testament to the openness of American writers to the new and (seemingly) exotic. It is also a marvelous gift to the literary world, and it is safe to say that nothing will ever be quite the same in our poetry." -- Christopher Merrill</p></p><h2>May I Have a Word?</h2><p>A battle of the magnet letters ensues across the refrigerator door in <i>May I Have a Word? </i>when C and K get into a fight about who gets to start the cooler (kooler?) words.

His Rule asks not for blind obedience and conformity but for personal responsibility.</p> <p>While the Rule offers much to those seeking a pattern to the structure of their day-to-day, exterior" life, which de Waal's previous commentaries have addressed, this commentary focuses on what Benedict tells us about the interior life. It takes the shape of prayerful reflections on his words of wisdom regarding the disposition of the heart. It leads the reader, as the Rule was meant to lead the novice, to answer the very personal question we must all, as Christians, answer: "Am I truly seeking God?"

Spence is one of the greatest Sinologists of our time, and his work is both authoritative and highly readable." &#x2015;<em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em></strong></p> China has transfixed the West since the earliest contacts between these civilizations. With his characteristic elegance and insight, Jonathan Spence explores how the West has understood China over seven centuries. Ranging from Marco Polo's own depiction of China and the mighty Khan, Kublai, in the 1270s to the China sightings of three twentieth-century writers of acknowledged genius-Kafka, Borges, and Calvino-Spence conveys Western thought on China through a remarkable array of expression. Peopling Spence's account are Iberian adventurers, Enlightenment thinkers, spinners of the dreamy cult of Chinoiserie, and American observers such as Bret Harte, Mark Twain, Ezra Pound, and Eugene O'Neill. Taken together, these China sightings tell us as much about the self-image of the West as about China. "Wonderful. . . . Spence brilliantly demonstrates [how] generation after generation of Westerners [have] asked themselves, 'What is it . . . that held this astonishing, diverse, and immensely populous land together?' "--<em>New York Times Book Review</em></p><p>Distinguished Yale historian Jonathan D. Spence examines the influence that China has long exercised on the Western imagination. Drawing on literary, historical, and travel writing from the 14th century to the present, he shows how the fabulations of medieval writers such as Marco Polo gave way to more factually minded reports from business travelers and diplomats. This then turned again to the exoticism of poets such as Ezra Pound and Charles Baudelaire, and in our time, returned to the realism of writers such as Pearl S. Buck and Edgar Snow. Spence's tour of these various ways of perceiving China yields a vigorous and interesting book that is of a piece with his many other studies of Chinese history. <i>--Gregory MacNamee</i>Jonathan D. Spence is Sterling Professor of History at Yale University, where he has taught for thirty years. He has been awarded MacArthur and Guggenheim Fellowships, and the Los Angeles Times Book Award.

It was the Sophists who understood the art of rhetoric and the importance of transforming effective reasoning into persuasive public speaking. Their enquiries - into the status of women, slavery, the distinction between Greeks and barbarians, the existence of the gods, the origins of religion, and whether virtue can be taught - laid the groundwork for the insights of the next generation of thinkers such as Plato and Aristotle.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

A best-selling author, his books include <em>Pathways, What in the World Is Going On?, Living With Confidence in a Chaotic World, Escape the Coming Night, Captured by Grace, The Coming Economic Armageddon, </em>and <em>I Never Thought I'd See the Day!.</em> He and his wife, Donna, reside in El Cajon, California.</p><h2>Paul&#39;s Letter to the Romans: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary</h2><p>While Paul&#x2019;s letter to the Romans is the most studied and commented-on document from the biblical period, the major exegetical books on Romans from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been overwhelmingly shaped by the Reformed tradition. Through a careful survey of work on Romans by both ancient Church Fathers and modern exegetical scholars, Ben Witherington III here argues that the interpretation of Romans since the Reformation has been far too indebted to &#x2015; and at key points led astray by &#x2015; Augustinian readings of the text as filtered through Luther, Calvin, and others.<br><br> In this first full-scale socio-rhetorical commentary on Romans, Witherington gleans fresh insights from reading the text of Paul&#x2019;s epistle in light of early Jewish theology, the historical situation of Rome in the middle of the first century A.D., and Paul&#x2019;s own rhetorical concerns. Giving serious consideration to the social and rhetorical background of Romans allows readers to hear Paul on his own terms, not just through the various voices of his later interpreters. Witherington&#x2019;s groundbreaking work also features a new, clear translation of the Greek text, and each section of the commentary ends with a brief discussion titled &#x201c;Bridging the Horizons,&#x201d; which suggests how the ancient text of Romans may speak to us today.</p><p>Ben Witherington III is Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky. Related "kingdom" books of his include &lt;em&gt;Imminent Domain: The Story of the Kingdom of God and Its Celebration&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/DIV&gt;<b>Craig S. Keener</b><br> "Ben Witherington is one of the most outstanding New Testament scholars of our generation, and in this commentary on Romans he brings his usual breadth of knowledge and reverence to the text. Scholars will appreciate the fresh analysis and rhetorical insights, while the work's clear language and sensitivity to Paul's message make it ideal for general readers desiring a readable commentary. "<br><br><b>Christopher Bryan</b><br> "Ben Witherington's sensible, clearly written commentary is based on a sound knowledge of the first-century Jewish and Greco-Roman discourses of which Paul's letter to the Romans was a part, yet it also makes a point of addressing issues and concerns pertinent to twenty-first-century Christian life and faith. This volume should prove a valuable resource for students and preachers alike."<br><br><b><i>Christian Chronicle</i></b><br> "An excellent resource for those who want a scholarly, in-depth study of Romans."</p><h2>Make Room for What You Love: Your Essential Guide to Organizing and Simplifying</h2><p>Your home is where life happens.

Working closely with modern descendants of those earlier inhabitants, Spector examined various tasks of daily life to try to reconstruct gender roles in the culture. In this endeavor, the awl of the title, uncovered in the dig, becomes important both for what it is able to tell us about gender roles and as a metaphor for what Spector believes should be the methodology of anthropologists. The history and daily life of the Wahpetons is imaginatively reconstructed by the author from the bits and pieces discovered in the earth. She writes with an energy and enthusiasm that make interesting what could be academic and dull. Despite her sensitivity to Natives, or perhaps because of it, one cannot help but wonder if she, in the same way as her predecessors, has not looked into the mirror of the past and seen only a reflection of herself. Still this fascinating account should interest both scholar and lay reader alike. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc."What is perhaps most significant about this book is the lesson that good archaeology can reflect feminist scholarship and can involve native descendants of the people who lived at what is today an archaeological site in a mutually beneficial partnership.

Such activism is certainly not new, but the conscious merger of community organizing tactics with religious beliefs may be. The organizing approach comes from Aul Alinsky and his Industrial Areas Foundations (IAF). . . . The book is structured around the polifical life of Ernesto Cortes Jr., the lead IAF organizer who has earned recognition as one of the most powerful individuals in Texas (and who has been featured on Bill Moyers' &#x201c;World of Ideas&#x201d;). . . . Cortes fashioned a hard-ball Alinsky approach onto the natural organizing ground of church-based comunities. The experiment began in San Antonio . . . and was successful in the transformation of San Antonio politics. <br><br>Such dramatic success . . . led to similar efforts in Houston, Fort Worth, El Paso, the Rio Grande Valley, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and New York, to mention only a few sites. Expansion beyond San Antonio meant organizing among Protestant churches, among African American and white, and among middle-class communities. In short, these organizing efforts have transcended the particularistic limits of religion, ethnicity, and class while maintaining a church base and sense of spiritual mission. . . . <br><br>Rogers's clearly written book will be of great value to the scholar, student, and layperson interested in urban politics, ethnic relations, social movements, or church activism.</p><p>" I am indebted - as no doubt you shall be upon reading this robust story of faith and power politics - to Mary Beth Rogers for a wonderful reminder that the American Revolution is not over. It lives on in the cold anger and warm heart of Ernesto Cortes." - Bill Moyers <p>"Cold Anger is a story about a new kind of intervention in politics by working poor people who incorporate their religious values into a struggle for power and visibility. It is about women and men who promote public and private hope, political and personal responsibility, community and individual transformation. Even joy. As such, it is a rare story in American politics these days." - Prologue</p>Considering the importance which Latinos will have on American culture and politics in the 21st century, very little of a nonscholarly nature has been written about them. Rogers fills the gap somewhat with this journalistic biography of Ernesto Cortes, a grass-roots leader who teaches Latinos how to use the political system. A man who combines religion and secular ideology, Cortes is doing for the Latino communities nationally what Jesse Jackson did in Chicago a decade earlier. The book effectively captures the flavor of the movement in small, rural locales and in major urban centers, conveying Cortes's ideology and energy, as well as the issues close to the Latino heart. A welcome look at minority politics in the 1990s. Recommended for all libraries.<br><i>- Roderic A.

No, he had to go and marry Ms. Melanie Harmer&#x2014;aka the Hammer&#x2014;the meanest teacher at Dandelion Middle School.<br> <br>Dad and Melanie got engaged at the end of October, but they didn&#x2019;t want the hassle of a long engagement. So while other kids were putting away their Halloween costumes and trading candy with their friends, I was putting on my old Easter dress and trying not to puke the whole way over to the county courthouse, where it took the judge less than ten minutes to pronounce Dad and Melanie man and wife.<br> <br>As I stood there, watching them kiss, I wondered what it would be like to live with the Hammer and her two kids&#x2014;Olivia, who&#x2019;s my age; and Joey, who&#x2019;s eight&#x2014;in the house Dad and Melanie bought.<br> <br>Now, nearly a month later, it was the Saturday after Thanksgiving. Moving Day. Dad and I were in Dad&#x2019;s soon-to-be-vacated bedroom. The moving people had taken almost everything out of the house. We had just a few things to pack up before we left the only house I&#x2019;d ever lived in forever. With all the furniture gone, it didn&#x2019;t seem like a real home anymore. Of course, it hadn&#x2019;t felt like a real home for the last year and a half, since Mom died.<br> <br>I swept the floor while Dad went through a box of old clothes. Once I finished with the broom I checked &#x201c;Sweep Dad&#x2019;s Floor&#x201d; off the cleaning list I&#x2019;d made. The list was two pages long, but I was almost finished with it. Dad wanted the house to be spotless before he gave the keys to his real estate agent.<br> <br>Dad held up a green T-shirt. &#x201c;What do you think? Keep or toss?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Toss, definitely,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It has holes in the sleeves.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad stared at it and frowned. &#x201c;I guess. But I could find a use for it. Maybe when I paint?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dad, we talked about this,&#x201d; I reminded him. &#x201c;Toss it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, okay.&#x201d; Dad moved it into the trash pile, and then pulled out a raggedy sweatshirt. &#x201c;What about this one?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom gave you that one, remember?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Dad flushed, and hurriedly put it into his &#x201c;for keeps&#x201d; pile, muttering that he was sorry, and I felt like a big jerk. The sweatshirt was really shabby and falling apart, and it&#x2019;s not like I thought that by throwing it out he was forgetting Mom. But sometimes I feel like he&#x2019;s packed up and moved into Melanie&#x2019;s life and left me behind. Like I&#x2019;m an old sweatshirt that suddenly seems too small and too shabby. Maybe one day Dad had woken up and decided he&#x2019;d outgrown his old life. Our life. Then he met Melanie.<br> <br>While Dad finished going through the box, I consulted my list. Next up was &#x201c;Vacuum Your Room,&#x201d; so I headed for my bedroom. I paused in the empty living room. Memories of my mom filled these rooms and they spun around me like dust motes dancing in the sunlight. I wondered if the new owners would know how happy our family had been here&#x2014;before Mom got sick, that is. Would they know she used to sit by the fireplace and knit, or that there used to be a piano under the window where her music students would play during their afternoon lessons, or that next to that piano was a vintage record player where we played old records from her collection&#x2014;always records, never a CD or an iPod, because she felt a true fan of music should have a decent record collection?<br> <br>But now that piano was at my friend Izzy&#x2019;s house so her sister Carolyn could use it, and our record collection, along with the rest of our furniture, was packed up and on its way to the new house&#x2014;or on its way to the Goodwill, because Melanie said we no longer needed it.<br> <br>My room didn&#x2019;t look like a real bedroom anymore, either. I stared at the purple walls as I ran the vacuum cleaner. Mom and I had painted them together; she&#x2019;d even let me stay home from school one day to do it. A couple days later, after the paint had dried, she sat me down on my bed, and said, &#x201c;I have something to tell you.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s amazing how quickly six little words can change your entire life.<br> <br>Next on my list was: &#x201c;Wipe Down Dad&#x2019;s Closet.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pulled a paint-splattered folding chair up to the top shelf and was about to get started when I saw a dusty red envelope pushed against the corner. I flipped it over. On the outside it read, &#x201c;For Violet, For Christmas.&#x201d; I recognized the handwriting immediately.<br> <br>It was my mother&#x2019;s.</p><h2>Midnight Falcon (The Rigante Series, Book 2)</h2><p>Bane the Bastard is the illegitimate son of the Rigante king who men called Demonblade. Born of treachery, Bane grew up an outcast in his own land, feared by his fellow highlanders, and denied by the father whose unmistakable mark he bore&#x2013;the eyes of Connavar, one tawny brown, the other emerald green.<br><br>Hounded from the country of his birth, Bane found acceptance across the seas&#x2013;only to have it stripped away in an instant by a cruel and deadly swordsman. Now fighting as a gladiator in the blood-soaked arenas of the Empire, Bane lives for one thing: revenge. And he pursues his goal with the same single-minded determination that won his father a crown.<br><br>But more is at stake than a young warrior&#x2019;s quest for vengeance. The armies of the Stone are preparing to march on the lands of the Rigante. The fate of human and Seidh alike will be decided by the clash of swords&#x2013;and by the bonds of twisted love and bitterness between a father and a son . . .</p><p>Following <i>Sword in the Storm</i>, <i>Midnight Falcon</i> is David Gemmell's second novel in the Rigante sequence. This volume can stand alone, though the series will be more accessible if read in order.<p> Seventeen-year-old Bane, illegitimate son of King Connovar, comes to the city of Stone, a place of gladiatorial combat, corruption, and religious terror. Embittered by his father's refusal to acknowledge him, Bane's wildness leads to bloodshed before friendship and betrayal force him to accept the complexities of power and responsibility. The novel builds to an epic climax, as Bane must accept who he is in order to lead his people in a desperate battle for their very survival. </p><p> David Gemmell has created a detailed and realistic world in which the action is vividly described and often thrilling. Yet there is a melancholy tone, for the author is as concerned with the consequences of war and the nature of men of violence as he is with conflict itself. There is a sense of the tragedy of war, lending the sad grandeur of history to a strongly characterized and intelligent adventure. It is something the series has in common with Stephen King's haunting fantasy western epic <i>The Dark Tower</i>. <i>--Gary S.

At the age of twenty-four he fell passionately in love with sixteen-year-old Giustiniana Wynne, the beautiful, illegitimate daughter of a Venetian mother and British father. Because of their dramatically different positions in society, they could not marry. And Giustiniana&#x2019;s mother, afraid that an affair would ruin her daughter&#x2019;s chances to form a more suitable union, forbade them to see each other. Her prohibition only fueled their desire and so began their torrid, secret seven-year-affair, enlisting the aid of a few intimates and servants (willing to risk their own positions) to shuttle love letters back and forth and to help facilitate their clandestine meetings. Eventually, Giustiniana found herself pregnant and she turned for help to the infamous Casanova&#x2013;himself infatuated with her. <br><br>Two and half centuries later, the unbelievable story of this star-crossed couple is told in a breathtaking narrative, re-created in part from the passionate, clandestine letters Andrea and Giustiniana wrote to each other.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more romantic real-life story than the long, forbidden love affair of the 18th-century Venetian nobleman Andrea Memmo and a half-English beauty named Giustiniana Wynne. Andrea Di Robilant's <i>A Venetian Affair</i> is drawn in part from a cache of letters discovered by the author's father in his ancestral <i>palazzo</i> on the Grand Canal. In 1753, his ancestor Andrea Memmo had been introduced to a lovely girl of uncertain station (illegitimate, although her parents later married). The Wynnes's position was precarious enough in Venice's rigid society, and Giustiniana's mother took every step to prevent the young aristocrat from corrupting her daughter. But the two lovers began to meet in secret: exchanging letters through confederates and communicating in public through an elaborate code of nods and gestures. They even came within a few days of being married before further dark revelations about Giustiniana's family put a permanent end to their hopes. Although Memmo went on to have an illustrious career in the dying Venetian Republic, it is Giustiniana's astonishing later life that really captures the reader. <i>A Venetian Affair</i> provides both a rich picture of the times--including cameo appearances by that scamp, Casanova--and a convincing account of an enduring passion. <i>--Regina Marler</i>Andrea di Robilant was born in Italy and educated at Le Rosey and Columbia University, where he specialized in international affairs. He currently lives in Rome with his wife and two children and works as a correspondent for the Italian newspaper <i>La Stampa</i>.

If in the past I thought that it was enough to have genitals dangling between one's legs, now I began to doubt. I doubted, because Uncle Marcelo's did dangle but nobody in the village considered him a man. Then would the perfect male be one who fathered children? "Of course not," I answered myself. My grandfather fulfilled that function and, in the opinion of my grandmother, he shouldn't be considered a man because he had shown himself unable to impose order in the family. Would a man be a person who managed to subdue or dominate other people? I didn't know, and I tossed and turned in bed unable to fall asleep, until I saw my mother, walking before me. I followed her in silence, without asking about my father.<br>The next day my grandmother left for the farm and gave me a task: to go into the forest for wood, but not to mix with Dina and her friends, three girls who went everywhere together cloaked in mystery. With the basket already on her back, she bid me a dry farewell. As she drew away, I stared above all at her rival, leaning in the&nbsp;kitchen door and holding in her arms her youngest child, seven months old, and calling my grandmother&nbsp;an old crone.&nbsp;<br>"Don't you understand why Os� no longer visits your bed? It's because you're an old hag&nbsp;who no longer gets her monthlies! Do you want to give my husband your curse, eh?"<br>Aloof from the confrontation that took place between the two women, my grandfather calmly played checkers in the House of the Word. After the first round of the game was finished, he asked for his breakfast. Once I had served him, I left for the closest forest in search of firewood. Crossing the village, I felt that everyone looked at me strangely: the women who came to pray that their polygamous spouses would pay more attention to them during the day and especially at night; the men who returned from hunting and were selling the animals before reaching their homes; the girls who left with their mothers to work on the farms, lugging baskets or carrying their little brothers and sisters in their arms as was the custom; the children who played football in the village's arena.<br>When I reached the highway I ran into Dina and her friends. Oh my! I didn't want to join them, so I picked up my pace and lowered my head so our glances wouldn't meet. I feared that someone might see me with them and tell my grandmother. But it was useless. Dina, the nicest of the group, looked at me tenderly and said something that it seemed everyone already knew: "Your uncle Marcelo has fled the village along with the woman who lived with him. Last night they burned down his house while he slept. He is lucky to be alive."<br>"What are you saying?" I approached the girls, who were also carrying baskets. "And when did all this happen?"<br>"Last night," Dina answered, touching my arm.<br>The moment her arm touched me, I noticed I was trembling. I hunched over. We sat down together on the trunk of an Okoum� tree abandoned on the side of the highway.<br>"They demanded he offer his member for the good of the tribe. And your grandmother, along with the rest of the women in the village, had decided to cast out Restituta, who he lived with, for . . .&nbsp; "<br>"For what?" We were in the middle of a highway full of mud.<br>"For . . . that is . . . " She looked at the two other girls who went everywhere with her and then said in a low voice. "For being a whore. It seems that the women have the support of the priest, who says that your uncle's friend brought sin to the village."<br>"The priest has agreed that they set out to burn alive the . . .&nbsp; whore and my uncle?"<br>"No. The priest says that prostitution is sinful and so that it doesn't spread, she must be cast out from the village. How that is done was the idea of the women of the Adoration of the Virgin Mary. It seems that their husbands frequently visited the . . . whore."<br>We were silent for a long moment, and then Dina spoke again.<br>"As for your uncle, the true goal of the tribe was to burn down his house with him inside it. That's why the people set out with their torches already lit. However, they made a mistake in taking for granted that he was already asleep. They found him sitting on the terrace, talking with his companion."<br>On hearing this news, I wanted to run toward the burned house. Dina held me back and gave me a letter from Marcelo. I read it with trembling hands and tears, but with the fortitude that only the daughter of an unmarried Fang woman manages to accumulate during years of humiliations, interminable moments of loneliness, and the lack of paternal kindness in being the daughter of all the men in the world but of none in particular.<br>The letter said the following:<br>&nbsp;<br>Dear daughter:<br>I will always love you. You know that, right? All the love I feel for you doesn't fit in this letter that I write with great urgency and tears. Your grandparents, along with all the tribe, have cast me out of the village for various reasons: I decided not to lend my member for the good of all and I keep in my home the ashes of my father, which, according to them, have provoked the barrenness of the land and other disgraces in the village, including your uncle's infertility. And also, the woman who lives with me is a prostitute and receives visits from various men of the village, among those your grandfather. You are a young girl and easily influenced. You must know that I am innocent. You believe me, don't you? Of course I am, I am sure that my girl believes me. I shall hide in the Otosia forest near the M�ong River. I have a hut there. Visit me soon. I can't live without you. The girl who gives you this letter, Dina, is a friend of mine. With her, you can come whenever you want. In the end, I can live permanently in the forest. I am in good health, don't worry. I have brought with me only the painting of Guernica and my&nbsp;memories of your mother. I will talk to you about her when you wish and we can also talk about your father. My home is ash. Don't go there because they will associate you with the curses.<br>I love you very much, my daughter. And worry not: I will be well.<br>Your uncle who loves you,<br>Marcelo<br>&nbsp;<br>I couldn't believe the contents of the letter. Meanwhile, my companions were looking more nervous than I was. After a few minutes of silence broken only by sobbing, Dina spoke. She said that only ash and loneliness were left in my uncle's home. I felt somewhat relieved after having read the affection and the advice the letter contained. If Marcelo found happiness in the forest, which is where he spent the majority of his time anyway, then all the better. At last he was free from so much disdain for not fondling women or fathering offspring.<br>Soon we moved into the forest after traveling half a kilometer along a path that illusorily was called a highway&nbsp;but was barely an earthen track.<br>"Don't be friends with those girls, they're indecent and mysterious," I remembered my grandmother telling me. But these three adolescents defended my uncle because they considered that he lived as a free man. With their baskets on their backs, they said that he had become an example to follow in having dared to challenge the Council of Elders of the tribe.<br>"The tribe to whom I owed respect and submission?" I asked myself, walking behind the three girls. Only Dina had turned eighteen. She revealed herself to have a strong character and looked at everyone discreetly but without fear. The second young woman was named Pilar, a very quiet orphan. In the village people whispered that her mother had died from witchcraft, and since then her father had sworn to maintain chastity, despite not leading a religious life. In the House of the Word, my grandfather asked him where his seed rested (that is to say, his semen) if he didn't have a wife. He remained silent.<br>Pilar had a paramour: Pl�cido. I discovered this because once the boy gave me a letter to deliver to her at school. I opened it and inside I saw a drawing of a heart. How jealous I was! Nobody had ever made such a tender gift for me.<br>The three girls spoke of Marcelo with much affection, especially the last of them, whose name was Linda. And she was as pretty as her name meant, with lovely eyes and, especially, a nice rear. I always noticed her charms with some anxiety, for I knew that my feelings were destined for some man as tradition decreed. A man who I didn't yet know and who, according to my grandmother, must have money.<br>Linda described for us the kiss that my uncle had one day given her on her forehead as the tenderest kiss of her life and complained that her father never even spoke to her, unless it was to order her to do something.<br>"It was here," she said, as she touched the center of her forehead with the palm of her hand. She was standing in front of us, always with the basket on her back like every Fang woman, and smiling.<br>At that moment we stopped to rest from the long walk. We sat on one side of the track and began to tell one another anecdotes about our lives in our homes. I had nothing to tell. What would I talk about? The constant fights? My perpetual loneliness? My father's abandoning me? The heroes of my tribe who worried above all about getting women pregnant? Of course not! My life lacked emotion. But I found one subject of conversation: I hated my braids. Oh, how I hated them! I also detested lipstick, eyeshadow, blush, and everything used to paint women's faces.<br>It turned out that I wasn't the only one. Dina and Pilar were with me. The only one who adored makeup was Linda, who couldn't buy any because her father was addicted to cards and gambled away all the family's money. What would she call family? I didn't know where mine was. Or maybe I did. Perhaps my true family lay in the forest, where Marcelo took refuge. And I was desperate to see him that afternoon after cutting wood as my grandmother had ordered me to do.<br>My grandmother. Nothing remained any longer of the woman she once was. She had changed when her husband became polygamous. I couldn't believe all the fuss she was mixed up in as a result of this, and before saying good-bye to me she had promised me that later we would talk about Marcelo. I anxiously awaited that moment.<br>We four girls started walking again and, half an hour later, we found various dry trees that we decided to cut. The night before it had rained and the forest was cold, although not enough to put out the torches that burned the home of the man-woman and force him to abandon the village. This was once again the main subject of conversation of the three friends who I had joined, in disobedience of my grandmother.<br>But, far from starting to work, the girls cut down some large leaves from the trees, cleared a space on the ground, and placed the leaves on the ground like a blanket and sat down on them. I remained standing, holding a machete and watching them without fully understanding why they were doing what they were doing. But they were all cracking up with laughter, which gradually gave way to silence. The first of them to undress was Dina, who started to kiss Pilar. She kissed her on the mouth! The image produced a double sensation in me: shame and unease. I began to tremble and the machete I held fell to the ground, with a loud thud that the girls seemed not to hear. The last to join in was Linda. They kissed one another and they practically forgot about me, while inside me three ideas fought with one another: to keep working, to head back to the village, or to wait for them to finish.<br>Dina was in the middle between Pilar and Linda. She held out a hand to me: "Come on. Join us."<br>"No," I answered. "I can't."<br>"Don't worry. At first it seems strange, but it's nice. You don't need to obey your grandmother, she is not here to watch over you. Come on, try it, you'll like it. You are in the forest: the Fang forest is a free space. Now you are free."<br>I shook my head again and Dina stood up. She started to kiss me while the other two began to gently remove my clothes. I couldn't refuse a third time. I was enjoying it and for the first time in my life I felt free sexually.<br>We made love for fifteen minutes. At last I could caress Pilar's rear which had excited me so much in school every time it brushed against some part of my body when the teacher ordered us to all stand in a row to sing the national anthem.<br>That feeling had always made feel much shame. "I am sick," I told myself often, sick with sin, ashamed that my eyes weren't able to look away from her feminine charms. Sometimes I felt that I had no air in my lungs, when I was overcome with a feeling of guilt for not being like the other women around me, who were always telling anecdotes about their sex lives. Who would I talk to about my own? I didn't know how to answer that question, I was afraid even to think it.<br>As we got dressed again, Pilar confessed that my uncle had once discovered them making love in the forest. They begged him not to tell anyone. Later, the girls found him with a man in one of the shacks he had in the forest, located near the river where the fishermen of the village often went. Since then, they had shown&nbsp;great complicity toward one other, since they were all part of the same club.<br>"What club?" I asked, covering my nipples with the palms of my hand.<br>"The Indecency Club," Linda answered with a smile. She was always content and laughed all the time. "You've become the fourth indecent woman of the village. Before, we were only three."</p></p><h2>Race Riot: Chicago in the Red Summer of 1919 (Blacks in the New World)</h2><p>"The origins of the Chicago race riot of 1919 are to be found, not in high-level policy, but in gut-level animosities between black and white people who were generally inarticulate and presentist-oriented, and who did not record their motivations or feelings for posterity. . .

As he traces the structure and evolution of idealism as a doctrine, Frederick Beiser exposes a strong objective, or realist, strain running from Kant to Hegel and identifies the crucial role of the early romantics&#x2015;H�lderlin, Schlegel, and Novalis&#x2015;as the founders of absolute idealism.</p><p>Frederick C. Beiser is Professor of Philosophy at Syracuse University.[A] magnificent new book...That Beiser manages to keep the reader afloat as he steers through such deep and turbulent waters deserves the highest praise. Expository writing of unfailing lucidity is supported by reference to an unrivalled range of sources...I learned something from this book on almost every page...For anyone at all seriously interested in the topic this is now the place to start. (Michael Rosen <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2003-01-24)<br><br>Frederick Beiser's new work provides English readers [with] a comprehensive and masterly explanation of the central forces that shaped the important philosophical movement known as German idealism. <i>German Idealism</i> is well written, exquisitely argued, and copiously researched. It easily outdistances much of the German scholarship and will serve as a benchmark for future English language scholarship. It is a must-read for scholars of the field, a helpful, accessible guide for the interested, and a valuable resource for all historians of philosophy.

Lean takes a proactive approach &#x2013; it is not contingent on legislation. A serious Lean effort will tear apart an old inefficient entitlement-riddled culture and build it into something effective. </p> <p></p> <p><strong>Lean Safety: Transforming your Safety Culture with Lean Management</strong> takes lessons learned from Lean and applies them to the building of a world-class safety-first organization. Based on 30 years of experience with successful implementation of continuous improvement, Robert Hafey focuses the power of Lean improvement on the universal topic of safety. In doing so, he shows how Lean and safety are linked; that the achievement of one is often dependent upon achievement of the other. In this book, written for managers and executives as well as workers on the line, Hafey:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <p> </p><li>Challenges each stakeholder to think proactively and accept individual responsibility for safety</li> <li>Emphasizes that the building of a top safety program requires the building of a world-class safety culture</li> <li>Demonstrates how basic Lean tools are as applicable to safety as they are to Lean, such as the A3 problem-solving process and the facilitated kaizen blitz</li> <li>Removes fear from the accident investigation process so that root causes are addressed rather than hidden </li> <li>Establishes standards and metrics for safety management that are clearly definable and measurable </li> <p></p></ul> <p></p> <p>Any lasting improvement must become both institutionalized and perpetually capable of adaptation. World class safety is not about writing correct rules, but more about righting the culture responsible for the well-being of its stakeholders. </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Listen to what Robert Hafey has to say about Lean Safety.</p></p><p>With over 30 years in manufacturing, Robert Hafey is currently the Director of Lean Operations for a privately held manufacturer of mechanical hardware.<p><em>If the strength of your company is dependent on developing an exceptional workforce, then start where it matters most &#x2013; providing the tools for a safe, efficient and involved employee group.

Thomas Huxley and Samuel Wilberforce presented arguments for and against the theory in a dramatic and widely publicized face-off at the 1860 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford. Their encounter sparked a vigorous, complex debate that touched on a host of issues and set the stage for the Royal Society&#x2019;s consideration of whether or not they ought to award Darwin the Copley Medal, the society&#x2019;s most prestigious prize. While the action takes place in meetings of the Royal Society, Great Britain&#x2019;s most important scientific body, a parallel and influential public argument smoldered over the nature of science and its relationship to modern life in an industrial society.<br><br> A significant component of the <em>Darwin</em> game is the tension between natural and teleological views of the world, manifested especially in reconsideration of the design argument, commonly known through William Paley&#x2019;s <em>Natural Theology; or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity</em> (1802) and updated by Wilberforce. But the scientific debate also percolated through a host of related issues: the meaning and purposes of inductive and hypothetical speculation in science; the professionalization of science; the implications of Darwinism for social reform, racial theories, and women&#x2019;s rights; and the evolving concept of causation in sciences and its implications for public policy. Because of the revolutionary potential of Darwin&#x2019;s ideas, the connections between science and nearly every other aspect of culture became increasingly evident. Scientific papers and laboratory demonstrations presented in Royal Society meetings during the game provide the backdrop for momentous conflict, conflict that continues to shape our perceptions of modern science.<br><br><p><em>Reacting to the Past</em> is a series of historical role-playing games that explore important ideas by re-creating the contexts that shaped them. Students are assigned roles, informed by classic texts, set in particular moments of intellectual and social ferment.&nbsp;</p><p>An award-winning active-learning pedagogy, <em>Reacting to the Past</em> improves speaking, writing, and leadership skills, promotes engagement with classic texts and history, and builds learning communities. <em>Reacting</em> can be used across the curriculum, from the first-year general education class to &#x201c;capstone&#x201d; experiences. A <em>Reacting</em> game can also function as the discussion component of lecture classes, or it can be enlisted for intersession courses, honors programs, and other specialized curricular purposes.</p></p><p><p><strong>Marsha Driscoll</strong> is professor and chair of psychology at Bemidji State University, where she is also director of the Honors Program.

For some racial and educational groups, incarceration has become a depressingly regular experience, and prison culture and influence pervade their communities. Almost 60 percent of black male high school drop-outs in their early thirties have spent time in prison. In Punishment and Inequality in America, sociologist Bruce Western explores the recent era of mass incarceration and the serious social and economic consequences it has wrought. Punishment and Inequality in America dispels many of the myths about the relationships among crime, imprisonment, and inequality. While many people support the increase in incarceration because of recent reductions in crime, Western shows that the decrease in crime rates in the 1990s was mostly fueled by growth in city police forces and the pacification of the drug trade. Getting "tough on crime" with longer sentences only explains about 10 percent of the fall in crime, but has come at a significant cost. Punishment and Inequality in America reveals a strong relationship between incarceration and severely dampened economic prospects for former inmates. Western finds that because of their involvement in the penal system, young black men hardly benefited from the economic boom of the 1990s. Those who spent time in prison had much lower wages and employment rates than did similar men without criminal records. The losses from mass incarceration spread to the social sphere as well, leaving one out of ten young black children with a father behind bars by the end of the 1990s, thereby helping perpetuate the damaging cycle of broken families, poverty, and crime. The recent explosion of imprisonment is exacting heavy costs on American society and exacerbating inequality. Whereas college or the military were once the formative institutions in young men's lives, prison has increasingly usurped that role in many communities. Punishment and Inequality in America profiles how the growth in incarceration came about and the toll it is taking on the social and economic fabric of many American communities.</p></p><p>BRUCE&nbsp;WESTERN is professor of sociology at Princeton University.</p><h2>Twice a Stranger</h2><p>It was a massive, yet little-known landmark in modern history: in 1923, after a long war over the future of the Ottoman world, nearly two million citizens of Turkey or Greece were moved across the Aegean, expelled from their homes because they were the &#39;wrong&#39; religion. Orthodox Christians were deported from Turkey to Greece, Muslims from Greece to Turkey. At the time, world statesmen hailed the transfer as a solution to the problem of minorities who could not co-exist.

Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen, who is on the organizing committee for Crozet High's twentieth reunion, decides to take it as a compliment. Others think it's a joke. <br><br>But Mrs. Murphy senses trouble. And the sly tiger cat is soon proven right ... when the class womanizer turns up dead with a bullet between his eyes. Then another note followed by another murder makes it clear that someone has waited twenty years to take revenge. <br><br>While Harry tries to piece together the puzzle, it's up to Mrs. Murphy and her animal pals to sniff out the truth. And there isn't much time. Mrs. Murphy is the first to realize that Harry has been chosen Most Likely to Die, and if she doesn't hurry, Crozet High's twentieth reunion could be Harry's last.</p><p>When a mystery author claims her cat as coauthor, it's a fairly safe bet that the team won't be producing disturbing psychological thrillers or hard-edged legal procedurals. And indeed, Rita Mae Brown and her cat, Sneaky Pie, have carved out a comfortable niche for themselves in the cozy category, spinning tales (<i>Rest in Pieces</i>; <i>Murder, She Meowed</i>; <i>Cat on the Scent</i>) around the goings-on in Crozet, a small Virginia town where everyone knows everyone else and recipes and gossip are exchanged over the post office counter. Mary Minor Haristeen ("Harry") is Crozet's postmistress and the proud owner of two cats, Mrs. Murphy and Pewter, and one corgi, Tee Tucker--animals with an uncanny ability to sniff out secrets and hidden motives as well as mice and roast beef.<p> <i>Pawing Through the Past</i> capitalizes on the myriad subtle relationships that form the backbone of small-town culture, and which Brown and Sneaky Pie have carefully woven throughout the Mrs. Murphy series. In a nicely appropriate nod to that culture's rivalries and alliances, Brown has chosen a high school reunion--traditional hotbed of simmering unease--as her mise-en-sc�ne. When each member of the Crozet High Class of 1980 receives an anonymous note stating, "You'll never get old," most take it as a joke or a compliment. But when the class womanizer turns up with a bullet between his eyes, and more notes--and more bodies--start appearing, Harry and her menagerie find themselves at the center of a revenge plot 20 years in the making.</p><p> Brown's latest is replete with the sly asides that have endeared her to animal lovers--"Cats are by instinct and inclination dedicated anarchists"--and with the naively humorous "conversations" between the animals themselves. When Pewter, watching a team of police officers wrestling a stiff corpse out of a dumpster, wonders, "Why don't they just break his arms and legs?" Murphy replies knowingly, "They'd pass out. Humans are touchy about their dead." Unfortunately, these favorable attributes can't quite mask an incoherent plot, nor Brown's awkwardly pompous social commentary: "By and large, the women looked better than the men, testimony to the cultural pressure for women to fuss over themselves." But Brown's legions of fans will doubtlessly forgive these shortcomings, concentrating instead on the antics of a memorable four-legged and furry trio. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"As feline collaborators go, you couldn't ask for better than Sneaky Pie Brown."<br>-- The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Mrs. Murphy is a cat who detects her way into our hearts."<br>-- San Francisco Chronicle Book Review<br></p><h2>Modern Art and the Death of a Culture</h2><p><p>This disturbing but illuminating classic is a brilliant perspective on the cultural turmoil of the radical sixties and its impact on today's world, especially as reflected in the art of the time.

Over the centuries, generations have sketched coats of arms, embroidered family trees, established local genealogical societies, and carefully filled in the blanks in their bibles, all in pursuit of self-knowledge and status through kinship ties. This long and varied history of Americans&#x2019; search for identity illuminates the story of America itself, according to Fran�ois Weil, as fixations with social standing, racial purity, and national belonging gave way in the twentieth century to an embrace of diverse ethnicity and heritage.</p><p> </p><p> Seeking out one&#x2019;s ancestors was a genteel pursuit in the colonial era, when an aristocratic pedigree secured a place in the British Atlantic empire. Genealogy developed into a middle-class diversion in the young republic. But over the next century, knowledge of one&#x2019;s family background came to represent a quasi-scientific defense of elite &#x201c;Anglo-Saxons&#x201d; in a nation transformed by immigration and the emancipation of slaves. By the mid-twentieth century, when a new enthusiasm for cultural diversity took hold, the practice of tracing one&#x2019;s family tree had become thoroughly democratized and commercialized.</p><p> </p><p> Today, Ancestry.com attracts over two million members with census records and ship manifests, while popular television shows depict celebrities exploring archives and submitting to DNA testing to learn the stories of their forebears. Further advances in genetics promise new insights as Americans continue their restless pursuit of past and place in an ever-changing world.</p></p><p>Fran�ois Weil is the Chancellor of the Universities of Paris.

(Ariela Gross, author of <i>What Blood Won't Tell: A History of Race on Trial in America</i>)<br><br>For a nation...so committed presumably to the rejection of birth and blood, the people of the United States throughout their history have devoted an enormous amount of energy, time, and money to genealogy and the search for ancestors. To explain this anomaly--indeed, to explain how the search for ancestors evolved in different forms over four centuries and eventually became a distinctly American mode of genealogy--is the burden of Fran�ois Weil's well-researched and readable book, <i>Family Trees</i>. Weil, who is chancellor of the Universities of Paris and professor of history at the �cole des Hautes �tudes en Sciences Sociales, knows America well, but he has sufficient distance to be honest and dispassionate about it. The result is a succinct history of genealogy in a nation that supposedly denies the importance of birth and ancestors. (Gordon S.

In <i>Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning, </i>Eugene Gendlin examines the edge of awareness, where language emerges from nonlanguage. In moving back and forth between what is already verbalized and what is as yet unarticulated, he shows how experiencing functions in the transitions between one formulation and the next. A whole array of more than logical "characteristics" enables us to examine as well as to employ this new kind of thinking, which is not merely conceptual because it begins from the intricacy of felt meaning and returns to it again and again.<br><br><i>Experiencing and the Creation of Meaning</i> addressed the unavoidable variety of conceptual formulations and other questions that have now become central.<br></p><p>Eugene T. Gendlin received his Ph.D. in philosophy from the University of Chicago and taught there from 1963 to 1995. His philosophical work is concerned especially with the relationship between logic and experiential explication. Implicit intricacy cannot be represented, but functions in certain ways in relation to philosophical discourse. The applications of this &#34;Philosophy of the Implicit&#34; have been important in many fields.</p><h2>Life on Earth</h2><p><p><b>A new, beautifully illustrated edition of David Attenborough&#x2019;s groundbreaking <em>Life on Earth</em>.</b></p><p>David Attenborough&#x2019;s unforgettable meeting with gorillas became an iconic moment for millions of television viewers. <em>Life on Earth</em>, the series and accompanying book, fundamentally changed the way we view and interact with the natural world setting a new benchmark of quality, influencing a generation of nature lovers.</p><p>Told through an examination of animal and plant life, this is an astonishing celebration of the evolution of life on earth, with a cast of characters drawn from the whole range of organisms that have ever lived on this planet.

The mass executions, the mock trials, the betrayals and purges, the jailings and secret torture that ravaged the Soviet Union during the three decades of Stalin&#x2019;s dictatorship, were the result of a tight network of trusted henchmen (and women), spies, psychopaths, and thugs. At the top of this pyramid of terror sat five indispensable hangmen who presided over the various incarnations of Stalin&#x2019;s secret police. Now, in his harrowing new book, Donald Rayfield probes the lives, the minds, the twisted careers, and the unpunished crimes of Stalin&#x2019;s loyal assassins.<br><br>Founded by Feliks Dzierzynski, the Cheka&#x2013;the Extraordinary Commission&#x2013;came to life in the first years of the Russian Revolution. Spreading fear in a time of chaos, the Cheka proved a perfect instrument for Stalin&#x2019;s ruthless consolidation of power. But brutal as it was, the Cheka under Dzierzynski was amateurish compared to the well-oiled killing machines that succeeded it. Genrikh Iagoda&#x2019;s OGPU specialized in political assassination, propaganda, and the manipulation of foreign intellectuals. Later, the NKVD recruited a new generation of torturers. Starting in 1938, terror mastermind Lavrenti Beria brought violent repression to a new height of ingenuity and sadism.<br><br>As Rayfield shows, Stalin and his henchmen worked relentlessly to coerce and suborn leading Soviet intellectuals, artists, writers, lawyers, and scientists. Maxim Gorky, Aleksandr Fadeev, Alexei Tolstoi, Isaak Babel, and Osip Mandelstam were all caught in Stalin&#x2019;s web&#x2013;courted, toyed with, betrayed, and then ruthlessly destroyed. In bringing to light the careers, personalities, relationships, and &#x201c;accomplishments&#x201d; of Stalin&#x2019;s key henchmen and their most prominent victims, Rayfield creates a chilling drama of the intersection of political fanaticism, personal vulnerability, and blind lust for power spanning half a century.<br><br>Though Beria lost his power&#x2013;and his life&#x2013;after Stalin&#x2019;s death in 1953, the fundamental methods of the hangmen maintained their grip into the second half of the twentieth century. Indeed, Rayfield argues, the tradition of terror, far from disappearing, has emerged with renewed vitality under Vladimir Putin. Written with grace, passion, and a dazzling command of the intricacies of Soviet politics and society, <i>Stalin and the Hangmen</i> is a devastating indictment of the individuals and ideology that kept Stalin in power.</p><p>Donald Rayfield is professor of Russian and Georgian at the University of London and the author of a number of books on Russian writers and intellectuals, including an acclaimed biography of Anton Chekhov.Childhood and Family<br><br>Instead of saying something like &#x201c;X was raised by crocodiles in a septic tank in Kuala Lumpur,&#x201d; they tell you about a mother, a father . . .<br><br>Martin Amis, Koba the Dread<br><br>In the Russian empire, especially Georgia, 1878 was not a bad year to bring a child into the world. True, Georgians of all classes seethed with resentment. Their Russian overlords, into whose hands the last Georgian kings had surrendered their shattered realm at the beginning of the nineteenth century, ruled the country through a bureaucracy that was often callous, corrupt, and ignorant, while those Georgian children who went to school were instructed in Russian. The Russian viceroy in Tbilisi, however humane and liberal, was determined to keep things as they were: Armenians ran commerce, foreign capitalists controlled industry, while Georgian aristocrats and peasants, upstaged in their own capital city, led a more or less tolerable life in the fertile countryside.<br><br>Georgians had some reasons to be grateful for Russian rule. For nearly a century Georgia had been free of the invasions and raids by its neighbors that had devastated and periodically nearly annihilated the nation since the thirteenth century. Russians might impose punitive taxes, Siberian exile, and cultural humiliation, but, unlike the Turks, they did not decapitate the entire male population of villages and, unlike the Persians, they did not drive away the survivors of massacres to be castrated, enslaved, and forcibly converted to Islam. Under Russian rule towns had been rebuilt and railways linked the capital to the Black Sea, and thus the outside world. The capital city, Tbilisi, had newspapers and an opera house (even if it had no university). A new generation of Georgians, forced to become fluent in Russian, realized the dreams of their ancestors: they were now treated as Europeans, they could study in European universities and become doctors, lawyers, diplomats&#x2014;and revolutionaries. Many Georgians dreamed of regaining independent statehood; so far, few believed that they should work toward this by violence. Most Georgians in the 1870s grudgingly accepted Russian domination as the price of exchanging their Asiatic history for a European culture.<br><br>For the inhabitants of the empire&#x2019;s metropolis, St. Petersburg, 1878 was a year that threatened to totter into anarchy. The terrorists who would kill Tsar Alexander II in 1881 were already tasting blood: the honeymoon between the Russian government and its intellectuals and new professional classes was over. The seeds of revolution found fertile ground not in the impoverished peasantry nor in the slums that housed the cities&#x2019; factory workers, but among the frustrated educated children of the gentry and the clergy who were not content to demand just human rights and a constitution. They went further and were plotting the violent overthrow of the Russian state. Such extremism might be fanatical but was not unrealistic. A rigid state is easier to destroy than to reform, and the Russian state was so constructed that a well-placed batch of dynamite or a well-aimed revolver, by eliminating a handful of grand dukes and ministers, could bring it down. The weakness of the Russian empire lay in its impoverished social fabric: the state was held together by a vertical hierarchy, from Tsar to gendarme. In Britain or France society was held together by the warp and weft of institutions&#x2014;judiciary, legislature, Church, local government. In Russia, where these institutions were only vestigial or embryonic, the fabric was single-ply.<br><br>The killers of Tsar Alexander II, the generation of Russian revolutionaries that preceded Lenin, saw this weakness but they had no popular support and no prospect of achieving mass rebellion. Russia in the 1880s and 1890s was generally perceived as stagnant, retrograde, even heartless and cynical&#x2014;but stable. Episodes of famine, epidemics, and anti-Jewish progroms rightly gave Russia a bad international name in the 1880s. The 1860s and 1870s had been a period of reform, hope, and, above all, creativity: Fiodor Dostoevsky, Ivan Turgenev, Leo Tolstoi, and Nikolai Leskov were writing their greatest novels. But the zest was gone: only the music of Piotr Tchaikovsky and the chemistry of Dmitri Mendeleev testified to Russian civilization. Nevertheless, there was tranquillity in stagnation. This was the Russian empire&#x2019;s longest recorded period of peace. Between Russia&#x2019;s victory over Turkey in 1877 and its defeat by Japan in 1905, half a human lifetime would elapse.<br><br>Around the time Ioseb Jughashvili was born on December 6, 1878, in the flourishing town of Gori, forty miles west of Tbilisi, the atmosphere among the town&#x2019;s artisans, merchants, and intellectuals was quietly buoyant. A boy whose parents had a modest income could secure an education that would make a gentleman of him anywhere in the Russian empire. Few observers had cause to agree with the prophecies of Dostoevsky and the philosopher Vladimir Soloviov: that within forty years a Russian tyranny so violent and bloody would be unleashed that Genghis Khan&#x2019;s or Nadir Shah&#x2019;s invasions would pale into insignificance by comparison. Even less did anyone sense that Ioseb Jughashvili, as Joseph Stalin, would be instrumental in establishing this tyranny over the Russian empire and would then take sole control of it.<br><br>yyyThe family that begot Ioseb (Soso) Jughashvili had no more reason than other Georgians to fear the future. The cobbler Besarion Jughashvili was in 1878 twenty-eight years old, a skilled and successful artisan working for himself; he had been married six years to Katerine (Keke), who was now twenty-two. She was a peasant girl with strong aspirations, well brought up, and had even been taught to read and write by her grandfather. Their first two sons had died in infancy; this third son, by Georgian (and Russian) tradition, was a gift from God, to be offered back to God. Katerine Meladze&#x2019;s father had died before she was born, and she was brought up by her uncle, Petre Khomuridze. In the 1850s the Khomuridzes had been serfs from the village of Mejrokhe near Gori but in 1861 Tsar Alexander II made them, like all serfs, freemen. Petre Khomuridze, once freed, proved an enterprising patriarch: he raised his own child and the children of his widowed sister. Katerine&#x2019;s brothers Sandro and Gio became a potter and a tile-maker respectively; when Katerine became a cobbler&#x2019;s wife, all the Meladze siblings had succeeded in rising from peasant to artisan status.<br><br>The family of Stalin&#x2019;s father Besarion seemed to be on the same upward course. Stalin&#x2019;s paternal great-grandfather, Zaza Jughashvili, had also lived near Gori, in a largely Osetian village. Zaza was also a serf. He took part in an anti-Russian rebellion in the 1800s, escaped retribution and was resettled, thanks to a charitable feudal prince, in a hovel in the windswept and semi-deserted village of Didi Lilo, ten miles north of Tbilisi. Here Zaza&#x2019;s son Vano moved up the social ladder: he owned a vineyard. Zaza&#x2019;s two grandchildren Giorgi and Besarion seemed destined to climb further. After Vano&#x2019;s death, Giorgi became an innkeeper but their rise to prosperity was brutally interrupted: Stalin&#x2019;s uncle Giorgi was killed by robbers, and his younger brother Besarion, destitute, left for Tbilisi to be a cobbler. By 1870 the Jughashvilis had resumed their climb: working for an Armenian bootmaker, Besarion acquired not only his craft, but learned to speak some Russian, Armenian, and Azeri Turkish, as well as Georgian. Unlike most Georgian artisans at that time, Besarion was literate.<br><br>One in three great dictators, artists, or writers witness before adolescence the death, bankruptcy, or disabling of their fathers. Stalin, like Napoleon, Dickens, Ibsen, and Chekhov, was the son of a man who climbed halfway up the social ladder and then fell off. Why did Besarion Jughashvili fail, when everything seemed to favor a man of his origins and skills? Contemporaries recall little of Besarion. One remembers that the Jughashvilis never had to pawn or sell anything. Another remembers: &#x201c;When Soso&#x2019;s father Besarion came home, we avoided playing in the room. Besarion was a very odd person. He was of middling height, swarthy, with big black mustaches and long eyebrows, his expression was severe and he walked about looking gloomy.&#x201d; Whatever the reasons, in 1884, when Stalin was six, Besarion&#x2019;s affairs went sharply downhill. The family moved house&#x2014;nine times in ten years. The cobbler&#x2019;s workshop lost customers; Beso took to drink.<br><br>Early in 1890 the marriage of Stalin&#x2019;s parents broke up. This was the last year the young Stalin had any contact with his father: the twelve-year-old boy was run over by a carriage and his father and mother took him to Tbilisi for an operation. Besarion stayed in the capital, finding work at a shoe factory. When the boy recovered, Besarion gave him an ultimatum: either become an apprentice cobbler in Tbilisi or return to Gori, follow his mother&#x2019;s ambitions, train to be a priest, and be disowned by his father. Soso went back to school in Gori in autumn 1890. Besarion, after visits to Gori to beg Katerine to take him back, vanished. (Stalin later stated in official depositions that his father had abandoned the family.) Besarion Jughashvili became an alcoholic tramp. On August 12, 1909, taken to the hospital from a Tbilisi rooming house, he died of liver cirrhosis. He was buried in an unmarked grave, mourned only by one fellow cobbler.<br><br>Some Georgians found it hard to believe that Stalin could have such lowly origins: they speculated that Stalin was illegitimate, which would explain Besarion deserting his &#x201c;unfaithful&#x201d; wife and her offspring. Legend puts forward two putative fathers for Stalin: Nikolai Przhevalsky, explorer of central Asia, and a Prince Egnatashvili. It is true that Stalin physically resembled Przhevalsky but the latter was a misogynistic homosexual, camped on the Chinese border when Stalin was begotten. In Soviet times two Egnatashvili brothers, related to the priest who married both Stalin and Stalin&#x2019;s parents, and to the Prince Egnatashvili for whom Katerine allegedly did housework, led remarkably charmed lives. Stalin was frequently called a bastard and whoreson, but the abuse was figurative. Adultery in a small Georgian town was rare: Keke was a conventional, if strong-willed, wife and mother, and Ioseb was undoubtedly Besarion&#x2019;s son.<br><br>Stalin discouraged prying into his origins and was most evasive about his father; only in 1906 did he give him the most cursory acknowledgment when he briefly adopted a new pseudonym for his journalism: Besoshvili (son of Besarion). Katerine exerted a more prolonged influence on her son. She bequeathed her obstinacy in pursuing goals. Ruined then deserted, constantly moving house, demoted from artisan&#x2019;s wife to drudge, she nevertheless scraped together the money and cajoled the authorities to get her son off the streets and into school. By several accounts she beat Ioseb as often as Besarion did, but for nobler reasons. Religious piety and instinct told her that education, preferably directed at the priesthood, provided the only way in which her son could make his way in the world. Katerine was nothing if not single-minded; religion and her son were her only interests. Her sole surviving letter to Stalin, from the 1920s, shows how much she had in common with him: &#x201c;My dear child Ioseb first of all I greet you with great love and wish you a long life and good health together with your good family. Child, I ask nature to give you complete victory and the annihilation of the enemy. . . . Be victorious!&#x201d;<br><br>If Stalin avoided speaking of his father, he was conventionally, if casually, fond of his mother. He sent her short letters and sporadic gifts of money. In the 1930s Katerine could be seen, an austere widow in black, carrying her basket to Tbilisi&#x2019;s collective-farm market accompanied by a squad of smart NKVD guards&#x2014;at the fawning initiative of Lavrenti Beria, not at her son&#x2019;s behest. Stalin visited his mother twice in the 1920s and once in 1935. He just sent a wreath to her funeral.<br><br>All who came across Stalin in power were struck by his self-sufficiency and solitude. Perhaps Stalin&#x2019;s solitary habits came from being the only son of an impoverished and lonely woman, but was his childhood the solitary hell that would produce a psychopath? What we can glean of Ioseb&#x2019;s childhood does not bear this out. The Jughashvilis lived on amicable terms with their neighbors, who were cosmopolitan, upwardly mobile artisans. Nearby lived Katerine&#x2019;s extended family&#x2014;craftsmen and innkeepers, with connections to merchants and even aristocrats. Like Beso&#x2019;s first two short-lived sons (Mikhail 1875, Giorgi 1876) Ioseb Jughashvili had prominent godfathers on whom the family could also count for support. The young Stalin had for company a foster brother (apprenticed to Besarion) a year younger than himself, Vano Khutsishvili. Vano had no complaints when in 1939 he recalled their apparently happy childhood in a letter to Stalin.6 Even after Besarion parted from his wife and son, Katerine and Ioseb kept up contact with that side of the family. Besarion&#x2019;s sister was married to a Iakob Gveseliani, and although they lived near Tbilisi their offspring, Ioseb&#x2019;s cousins, often visited Gori. As for Katerine, she and her children were part of an extended family in Gori, including her cousin Mariam Mamulashvili, who had seven children. Not until his twenties could Stalin have known involuntary solitude.<br><br>Stalin&#x2019;s cousins&#x2014;particularly Pepo (Euphemia) Gveseliani on his father&#x2019;s side and Vano Mamulashvili on his mother&#x2019;s side&#x2014;kept in touch with him until his death. They sent letters&#x2014;ingratiating, begging, sometimes affectionate. They came to Moscow and on two occasions threatened to commit suicide if Stalin refused to see them. His cousins were the only family category for whom Stalin never sanctioned arrests (Stalin&#x2019;s in-laws, the Svanidzes and Alliluevs, suffered the same near-extermination as did other &#x201c;old Bolsheviks&#x201d;). Admittedly, Stalin did his blood relatives few favors&#x2014;they endured the same hardships all Georgia&#x2019;s peasantry and artisans underwent after the revolution&#x2014;but they were the only human beings with whom Stalin sustained a semblance of normal relations. In his old age he would send them and some schoolmates parcels of cash (his earnings as a Supreme Soviet deputy). In 1951, General Nikolai Vlasik, the commandant at Stalin&#x2019;s dacha, drew up a list of Stalin&#x2019;s surviving relatives and schoolmates for a bus trip to a reunion in Georgia. Vlasik would not have dared to do so had Stalin not shown some last flicker of human affection.<br><br>The most telling events in Stalin&#x2019;s childhood are his brushes with death: his years in Georgia were marked by crippling illnesses and ghastly traffic accidents. All his life Stalin was rarely free of physical pain&#x2014;which must have stimulated his sadism and irritability&#x2014;and most of his pain, mental as well as physical, was a residue of childhood. He survived all the childhood illnesses&#x2014;from measles to scarlet fever&#x2014;that had carried off his infant brothers but in 1884 caught smallpox and was left badly scarred, earning the nickname Chopura (Poxy). Soon afterward he was run over by a carriage, and the subsequent blood poisoning apparently withered his left shoulder and arm. In early 1890 in another street accident his legs were run over by a carriage and Ioseb acquired another nickname, Geza (Crooked).</p><h2>Silent Warfare: Understanding the World of Intelligence, 3rd Edition</h2><p>A thoroughly updated revision of the first comprehensive overview of intelligence designed for both the student and the general reader, <i>Silent Warfare</i> is an insider&#x2019;s guide to a shadowy, often misunderstood world.

Jeffrey Burton Russell here chronicles the remarkable story of the Devil from antiquity to the present. While recounting how past generations have personified evil, he deepens our understanding of the ways in which people have dealt with the enduring problem of radical evil.After a compelling essay on the nature of evil, Russell uncovers the origins of the concept of the Devil in various early cultures and then traces its evolution in Western thought from the time of the ancient Hebrews through the first centuries of the Christian era. Next he turns to the medieval view of the Devil, focusing on images found in folklore, scholastic thought, art, literature, mysticism, and witchcraft. Finally, he follows the Devil into our own era, where he draws on examples from theology, philosophy, art, literature, and popular culture to describe the great changes in this traditional notion of evil brought about by the intellectual and cultural developments of modern times.Is the Devil an outmoded superstition, as most educated people today believe? Or do the horrors of the twentieth century and the specter of nuclear war make all too clear the continuing need for some vital symbol of radical evil? A single-volume distillation of Russell's epic tetralogy on the nature and personifcation of evil from ancient times to the present (published by Cornell University Press between 1977 and 1986), <i>The Prince of Darkness</i> invites readers to confront these and other critical questions as they explore the past faces of that figure who has been called the second most famous personage in Christianity.</p></p><p>Jeffrey Burton Russell is Professor of History Emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<p>"There is probably no one alive who knows more about the lore of the Devil than Jeffrey Burton Russell....

Unlike their rather distressing portrait of the more reactive Generation X (the 13th Gen), or the negative stereotypes that abound about today's kids, this is all good news. According to Howe and Strauss, this group is poised to become the next great generation, one that will provide a more positive, group-oriented, can-do ethos. Huge in size as well as future impact, they're making a sharp break from Gen-X trends and a direct reversal of boomer youth behavior. Why? Because, as a nation, we've devoted more concern and attention their way than to any generation in, well, generations.<p> Using their trademark paradigm, which places each generation as part of a larger historical cycle with four generations to a cycle, the authors not only describe these kids as they are now (as the first year sets off for college, the last yet to be born) but launch into projections for the future. A sampling of their potential influence in this decade: pop music will become more melodic and singable and sitcoms more melodramatic and wholesome; there will be a new emphasis on manners, modesty, and old-fashioned gender courtesies; and they'll resolve the long-standing debates about substance abuse. "They will rebel against the culture by cleaning it up, rebel against political cynicism by touting trust, rebel against individualism by stressing teamwork, rebel against adult pessimism by being upbeat, and rebel against social ennui by actually going out and getting a few things done." Scanning the future further, this hero generation will have to confront some major crises. But, for a group that has never known war or famine, will it be an opportunity or a calamity? Much of <i>Millennials Rising</i> is familiar territory rehashed, and the profiles and prophecies just too general. But it's hard to resist this hopeful vision for our children and the future. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>in the '60s, it was the Boomers. In the '90s, it was the Xers. Now, it's the Millennials -- who are graduating from high school and flooding the nation's college campuses. In Millennials Rising, bestselling authors Howe and Strauss reveal who these kids are and where they're going. They explain ...<br>-- Why Millennials are protected, pressured, and celebrated far more than Boomers or Gen Xers ever were<br>-- Why civic spirit and test scores are up, and crime and risky behavior down<br>-- Why today's kids are held to higher standards than adults apply to themselves<br>-- Why Millennials are a lot less violent, vulgar, and sexually charged than the teen culture older people are producing for them<p>A decade ago, in Generations, Howe and Strauss predicted many of the youth trends we are beginning to see today. Now, in this remarkable new book -- one that is certain to spark a heated national debate about the next generation -- the authors provide startling proof for how today's Millennial teens are defying conventional wisdom about youth.</p><p>Having taken their own polls, weighed all the data, talked with hundreds of kids, parents, and teachers, and reflected on the rhythms of history, Howe and Strauss offer this powerful conclusion: Before the decade is over, Millennials will reject the Gen X pop culture, rebel against Boomer politics, dramatically redefine what it means to be young, and, in time, become America's next great generation.</p></p><h2>Ministry Greenhouse: Cultivating Environments for Practical Learning</h2><p>For more information please visit www.rowman.com</p><p>George M.

As a Stanislavsky disciple and founder of her own highly esteemed acting conservatory, the extravagant actress was also an eminent acting teacher, training her students--among them Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and Robert DeNiro--in the art of script interpretation. <br><br>The classic lectures collected here, delivered over a period of forty years, bring to life the plays of the three fathers of modern drama: Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, and Anton Chekhov. With passionate conviction and shrewd insight, Adler explains how their plays forever changed the world of dramaturgy while offering enduring insights on society, class, culture, and the role of the actor. She explores the struggles of Ibsen's characters to free themselves from societal convention, the mortal conflicts that trap Strindberg's men and women, and the pain of loss and transition lyrically evoked by Chekhov. A majestic volume, <b>Stella Adler on Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov</b> allows us to experience the work of these masters "as if to see, hear and feel their genius for the first time." (William H. Gass)</p><p>"The book is superb. Stella's words burn off the page like her beauty, her scornful glance, her authority, and the fire in her truth."<br>-- Irene Worth<p>"A beautiful treasure for actors and directors. Brilliant and passionate."<br>-- Kim Stanley</p><p>"These inspired lectures are evidence that Stella Adler is hands down the greatest acting teacher America has produced. And they're not just for actors -- she illuminates Chekhov, Ibsen and Strindberg in a way that will challenge you, stimulate you and make you see. Nobody with a serious interest in the theater can afford to be without this book."<br>-- John Guare</p><p>"Stella Adler taught actors to invite into their performances the culture expressed by a role and a play rather than to become technicians. Her book should deepen actors' perceptions of their art and help them to make real for themselves theatre's humanistic heart."<br>-- Arthur Miller</p><p>"Stella's glorious conceit aside, throw out all of the other books on Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov and maybe those on acting as well, because now we have Stella's."<br>-- Zoe Caldwell</p><p>"Jacob Adler said that unless you give the audience something bigger -- better --do not act. Here is a book that will do that for its reader. To see Ibsen, Strindberg, and Chekhov through an actor whose eyes have been opened by Stella Adler is as if to see, hear and feel their genius for the first time. And to hear her teach is to hear teaching, not just acting, being taught. For those who like to keep in shape, there are exercises as well. You'll sweat, but that's the idea."<br>-- William H. Gass</p><p></p>Stella Adler died in 1992 at the age of ninety-one. Barry Paris lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.</p><h2>My Father, My King</h2><p>"When a person becomes aware of the reality of the Almighty's existence, he will experience limitless joy. All the pleasures of the world are as nothing compared to the intense pleasure of a person cleaving to his Creator." (Chazon Ish, Emunah U' Bitachon 1:9). <br>My Father, My King enables the reader to become more aware of this reality in all aspects of life. It will help intensify spiritual experiences and elevate the mundane. <br>We are accustomed to calling G-d Avinu Malkeinu, our Father, our King, but Rabbi Yisroel Salanter emphasized the importance of relating to Him in the singular: "The Creator of the universe is my Father, my King." Relating to the Creator in this way personalizes your relationship. <br>Following the pattern of Rabbi Meir (Berachos 17a), Rabbi Zelig Pliskin has presented a comprehensive overview of basic Torah principles from G-d's perspective. Each section is followed with insights and examples drawn from the author's extensive teaching and counseling experience. This approach will enlighten both the beginner and the scholar. The result is a book that will be a constant source of inspiration.</p><p></p><h2>From Here To Home (A Too Much, Texas Novel)</h2><p>"Marie Bostwick is my go-to author...always powerful, inspiring, and uplifting." &#x2013;Robyn Carr, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author<br><br><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Marie Bostwick welcomes readers to the quirky, unforgettable town of Too Much, Texas, in a heartwarming, richly satisfying story of friendship and moving forward...<br><br>Mary Dell Templeton prefers the quiet charms of Too Much to the bright lights of Dallas any day.

Without stating it outright, our culture&#x2014;via our parents, the media, and our peers&#x2014;implies that sex and sexual skills should come naturally, with all but the most advanced techniques being somehow instinctive. You'd never expect someone to hit a perfect tennis serve without lessons and practice or to play a beautiful sonata on an instrument they've only touched a couple of times, yet somehow, most of us come to maturity with the expectation that sexual skills will magically develop in the presence of our naked lover, that this lover will likewise experience a spontaneous onset of spectacular proficiency, and that it will all unfurl as smoothly as a movie montage.<br><br>Where do real-life Don Juans get their savoir faire? There's only one way: practice, practice, practice. Some people try to pick up tips from their friends, but while you may have a friend or two with information to spare, you're probably dealing with what literary critics calls an "unreliable narrator." (I personally stopped trusting the sexual knowledge of my peers when they asked me if my cherry had been popped, but could not specify what this "cherry" was, nor exactly where it was located.)<br><br><i>Real sex is awkward.</i> The fact is, if you expect great sex to come naturally, you're in big trouble, and your partner is in even bigger trouble. Giving great oral sex is dependent upon being truly comfortable with the act, "in good times and in bad." Real sex with live people is tricky&#x2014;it smells, it squeaks, it gets stuck on some things and rams too quickly into others. People get injured physically (especially in the shower) and emotionally (especially in affairs), and on the whole, doing it probably causes about as many problems as pleasures. This doesn't mean that you should stop&#x2014;in fact most of us should be having more sex rather than less.* But it does indicate that we have a lot of false expectations surrounding sex, and these expectations take a lot of the fun out of sex without our even knowing it.<br><b>ACCEPTING THESE REALITIES WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER LOVER</b><br><b>Sexual Skill Doesn't Come Naturally</b><br>Sure, the impulse to have sex is "natural," and the heat of passion is sure to lend a little on-the-spot inspiration, but sexual skill must be learned and practiced like anything else.<br><b>"If girls are made of sugar and spice, why do they taste like tuna fish?"</b><br>Genitals have a naturally pungent odor and taste. Some people love it, others don't. But you're in denial if you're surprised by it. If this is a concern for you, just take a bath or shower with your partner, instead of trying to skirt oral sex, or pretending to be comfortable going down when you're not. If you forge ahead anyway, your partner will sense your repressed discomfort, and the effort to conceal your true feelings will take the zest out of your performance. Barring a bath, be aware that a vagina will taste and smell very differently after it is stimulated enough to create the body's natural lubricants, which have an addictively delicious flavor. A little foreplay and hand action can change the menu entirely.<br><b>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Orgasm</b><br>What's the matter? Labia got yer tongue? Whether it's that funny slurping noise, a penis that veers to the right like it's catching a curve ball, or a pubic hair in your eye, unexpected things are bound to happen during sex. Who can say what they will be? One woman I know started laughing while her guy was coming in her mouth, and it ended up dribbling out of her nose. Things like this are a natural part of an active sex life, so you might as well expect them and make sure to bring your sense of humor with you to the bedroom. Taking sex too seriously is a sure passion-killer.<br><b>Genitals Look Funny</b><br>Believe it or not, the overall quality of oral sex is still being compromised by people's shame and fear of genitalia. The people giving oral sex are afraid to stare too much, because they don't want to make their partner feel uncomfortable, while their partner can barely even relax and enjoy themselves because they're so freaked out by someone sniffing around down there. Shocking as it is, this is occurring in the twenty-first century, and it's compromising the quality of oral sex. To overcome any vestiges of genital-fear, take a moment with your partner to really look at her genitals. Tell her why you want to do it, and make sure that she feels comfortable with it first. Then look&#x2014;really <i>look</i>&#x2014;at all the different parts, and acknowledge that these are what you have to work with. This exercise is worth it: an anatomically complete understanding of your partner's genitals will assure your subconscious that there is nothing "bad" or "dirty" or "scary" lurking in there anywhere.<br><br><b><br>"That was great. Really, it was . . ."</b><br>Most likely, no one's told you the truth about your sexual skills. The fact is, women fake orgasms pretty regularly, and it's a rare lover who openly communicates what they do or don't like, because they're trying to be nice. But withholding feedback is extremely counterproductive with regards to sex. The way people communicate about sex isn't even worthy of the term "miscommunication," because not only does withholding feedback send the wrong information (that you like something you don't or dislike something you do like), it actively obstructs future communication about sex. We're lucky consultants can't be called into the bedroom, because most people would be fired. The result? Very few men and women have been given enough feedback to develop a repertoire that works. And it's a damned shame. Since they haven't built up the strength and precision of their lips and tongue through a history of feedback and refinement, they develop a repertoire based on second-rate skills and subject every poor date they meet to it. As a loving pet-owner thinks their cat or dog is absolutely unique among the breed, everyone&#x2014;and I mean <i>everyone</i>&#x2014;thinks they have great sexual skills. Meanwhile, most people report more than a few instances of less-than-satisfying sex every year. You do the math.<br><br>You don't have to pass out a Comments and Suggestions card afterward, but you do need to elicit your partner's feedback. A whispered "Do you like that?" during oral sex will produce more honest feedback than a "Was that good for you?" after she's already decided that she just wants to be friends.<br><b>It's Not Just About the Orgasm</b><br>You don't have to make your partner come to have great oral sex. Great oral lovers are not orgasm-making machines, and if you treat oral sex this way you're not going to enjoy it&#x2014;and neither will your partner. Aside from straining yourself, your orgasm fixation will actually distract you from any subtle signs or signals given by your lover. You don't have to frantically chase orgasms. The orgasm will come to you. Straining and stressing about how long it's taking your partner to come wards off a real orgasm like a snake scares a mare, so it's better to just let go of this expectation and enjoy yourself. Experiment and play&#x2014;"the light touch," as it's sometimes called&#x2014;will inevitably create more pleasure for your partner than strain or stress.<br>People who perform poorly at oral sex are usually hung up on one or all of these basic issues. But there's another, related set of concerns that are a little more serious, and must be addressed for you to get the most out of giving&#x2014;and getting&#x2014;oral sex.<br><b>2<br><br>When Your Mind Spoils Your Head: What Wrecks Oral Sex</b><br>NO MATTER HOW much you might try to convince yourself that you are a sexual cavalier and not a vulnerable human being, sex is an intimate act. It almost always brings up somebody's emotions. Oral sex is in some ways even more intimate. There's a Chinese proverb that says if you save a person's life, they're yours forever. That's fine and well, but hair-pulling, moan-making, nail-sinking oral sex breeds its own strain of attachment, and it can be pretty fierce.<br><br>Partially because of the intense feelings of vulnerability it can provoke, some people have a very hard time opening themselves up to receiving oral sex. At the thought of someone else fully exploring their genitals and witnessing their states of uncontrolled ecstasy, some people begin to drool, while others snap closed like a clam. (Personally, I drool.) Control issues (<i>After all, what might that other person do down there? Will they try to stick something weird in my [insert most feared orifice here] or do something else that I'm not prepared for?</i>), self-doubt (<i>Do I smell down there? What if I have to fart? What if I didn't wipe well the last time I . . . you know. . . ?</i>), and a negative body-image (<i>Are they noticing my love-handles/cellulite/ass hairs or whatever aspect of my body I tend to despair over?</i>), as well as a plethora of other issues can take the fun out of oral sex faster than you can say the word "orgasm." And that's just on the receiving end!<br><br>On the giving end, performance anxiety and fear of being judged are chief among the pleasure killers. "<i>What if they don't like what I'm doing?</i>" "<i>What if I get tired and need to stop before they've had an orgasm?</i>" "<i>What if I can't bring them to orgasm?</i>" And for those who are hip to all the orgasm-faking going on: "<i>What if they're just pretending to like it?</i>" You may be surprised just how many people let thoughts like these crash their oral sex party.<br><br>While there is no magic potion to remove these inhibitions (other than drugs and alcohol, which are <i>not</i> long-term solutions!), there are some steps, before, during, and after your rendezvous that can help you to better relax and enjoy yourself. Being comfortable and happy make almost anything you do better, and this goes double for oral sex. In order to devote yourself fully to giving and receiving pleasure, you need to be as deep in the pleasure groove as you can get.<br><br><b><br>GETTING READY TO RUMBLE: A DATING GUIDE FOR FABULOUS ORAL LOVE</b><br><br>For those of you who are perfectly comfortable with your body, have no trouble relaxing and getting down to business, and are 100 percent ready for action, skip this bit and go straight to chapter 3. For those of you who have been single for a while, tend to fumble with sexual tension, or simply feel that you could be better at relaxing and enjoying the ride, here's some information on how to prepare your <i>entire</i> being for oral sex.<br><br>Before going out with a sexual partner or soon-to-be sexual partner, most people spend time squinting in the mirror and picking out their most flattering clothes. Paying a little extra attention to your appearance and hygiene before a date is a natural inclination&#x2014;and should be de rigueur if you're hoping for future dates&#x2014;but the buck rarely stops there. All over the country, people go tearing through their closets looking for the "right" outfit, wrestling into one sweater just to run to the mirror and frown. "You're fat," the mirror says back, "and I'm not granting you any wishes." Noticing a new pimple or wrinkle just before a date has furrowed countless brows. "This big, ugly pimple next to my mouth looks <i>awful</i>&#x2014;they'll probably think I have herpes! Maybe I should just cancel." These thoughts and feelings aren't restricted to ephemera&#x2014;our more substantial physical "flaws" provoke even more nerve-racking thoughts. "My pubic hair is turning silver," an older friend confided in me, "and I don't know what's more painful: their facial expression when my underwear comes off, or plucking the damned things."<br><br>Fretting seems harmless, but how are you going to get comfortable and enjoy what your body can do if you've spent all the time before your date chastising it? The seeming innocuousness of predate fretting is only skin-deep: it has very real consequences for sex and physical pleasure.<br><b>Shower Power</b><br>Being clean and sweet-smelling is a considerate gesture that says to your partner "I want you to enjoy contact with my body," and it can boost your self-confidence. However, criticizing your body on <i>any</i> level will impede your oral sex performance, because how you feel about your own body will be played out in how you react to your lover's. It can also distract you from your partner's subtle signals, and delay your own orgasms. Is being zitless and well-dressed worth it? Is <i>anything</i>? Of course, you should look nice for your date&#x2014;but obsessive thoughts have a momentum of their own and cannot be cast off as easily as clothing.<br><br>Consider limiting your preening time to around fifteen minutes&#x2014;just enough time to cover the basics, not enough to nitpick. Use the rest of the time to prepare yourself psychologically to have fun and relax.<br><b>The Two Big Basics</b><br>These are very simple ideas, but disregarded by one and all. First, wear comfortable clothes. Not quite the jeans with holes and your favorite tattered sweater, but make it a rule to avoid tight or restricting clothes, and clothes that are out of character for you. If you don't look like yourself, you won't act like yourself. (Also, it's not a bad idea to save the tight jeans and fancy shirts for a time when you may need the kinkiness.)<br><br>Second, use the time before your date to <i>relax</i> and <i>unwind</i>. If going on your date straight from work, take a walk around the block just to absorb the atmosphere of the neighborhood, or treat yourself to something that will loosen you up&#x2014;maybe it's listening to music, getting a beer, or going in a pet store and watching puppies tussle. Whatever it is, it needs to relax you. For more serious stress cases, it may take a ten-minute massage or short workout. No matter what your stress level is, though, there's one cure-all: breathing. The breathing exercises outlined in chapter 7 are among the best stress antidotes around. They cost nothing, take little time, and relax you utterly. But if you want to be giving off your most sexual vibes, there are some specific activities that will send sparks flying on contact.<br><br>If you don't have time to relax and unwind before a date, simply pop into the bathroom and look at yourself in the mirror. Do you like yourself? If you don't get a resounding, "Hell yeah, I'm awesome!" keep looking at yourself and just say it out loud: "I like me." Say it until you start to mean it, and then you can go rock the world. Feeling good about yourself makes everything you do better.</p><h2>The Beatles for Ukulele</h2><p>(Ukulele).

In fact, of all the questionable decisions she'd made since abandoning civilization for her tiny mountain cabin seven months ago, this was probably the worst.</p> <p>At least, Lou mused wryly, it was a beautiful place in which to do a dumb thing. The sun lit the snowcapped mountains circling like sleepy sentinels around them, and the wind chased powdery snow across the frozen reservoir. Despite the cold, it still smelled strongly of fish.</p> <p>"Ready for some ice-rescue training?" Derek bumped his neoprene-covered arm against hers. He seemed much too cheerful for a guy about to dive into glacial water.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Aww, Lou." When he tried to pat her head with one of his bright blue gloves, she ducked out of reach. "Nervous?"</p> <p>"Of course not. Why would I be nervous about jumping into a hole in the ice and swimming around in thirty-two-and-a-half-degree water? Why did I join the Field County Rescue Dive Team and not the Jamaican Whatever again?"</p> <p>"Because I would not be on the Jamaican Dive Team," Derek answered. "And I make it worth the cold."</p> <p>"Yeah, not really."</p> <p>"Hey!" He smacked her arm, she laughed and whacked him back, and then it evolved into a full-fledged slap fight. The blue-nitrile shade of their gloves made them look like life-size cartoons, and Lou couldn't hold back another laugh.</p> <p>"Sparks!"</p> <p>Callum's bellow froze her in place. She shot Derek a wry glance before turning to face their team leader. She took careful, deliberate steps in the clumsy dry-suit boots, as humiliation was better served in small doses. Being caught goofing off was bad enough. She didn't need to fall on her ass, as well.</p> <p>"Yes?" She eyed his scowling face. It was too bad about his surliness, since Callum was a joy to look upon otherwise, in a gladiator-meets-drill-sergeant kind of way. His blond hair was military short, and his eyes were a startling and beautiful blue against tanned skin. His jaw was square, and his body... Taking a deep breath, she carefully did not check out the neoprene-wrapped perfection below his neck.</p> <p>Because...damn.</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>Somehow, answering "Fooling around with Derek" did not seem like the best idea. "Uh...nothing."</p> <p>He stared at her, heavy frown still in place. "It didn't- Never mind. You're like a terrier with ADD. Why can't you stand still for five minutes?"</p> <p>"Because..." She shot a glance at Derek. The traitor had taken several steps back and was pretending to examine a seam on his dry-suit sleeve. "He... I just...Um, the gloves..."</p> <p>Callum let the silence hang for several seconds. When he eventually turned away from Lou, she let out the breath she'd been holding and shuffled over to rejoin Derek. Once there, she punched him lightly-well, sort of lightly-in the kidney.</p> <p>"Ouch." He gave her an injured look. "What was that for?"</p> <p>"Why am I always the one who gets in trouble?"</p> <p>"Because you're the one who starts it."</p> <p>"Do not," she protested, realizing she'd gotten a little loud only when Callum's eyes focused on her again. Dropping her gaze, she studied the half-frozen puddle in front of her boots. It seemed as if every single time she did something embarrassing, Callum was there, watching her with the look-a mix of exasperation and irritated bafflement. The sad part was that, even after three months of getting the look, Lou still wasn't able to smother the obnoxious butterflies that fluttered in her belly whenever she was the center of his attention.</p> <p>"You done?" he asked. At her nod, he jerked his chin toward the icy reservoir.</p> <p>Lou fell in line with the six other divers, taking slow, exaggerated steps to avoid tripping over her own neoprene-wrapped feet or slipping on the ice. As they reached the large opening that had been carved out earlier in the day for the training exercise, Lou peered at the water, frowning.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" Derek asked, stepping up beside her and following her gaze as if looking for the answer to his own question.</p> <p>She shrugged. "All that ice around the edge makes the water look really cold."</p> <p>Bumping her with his elbow, he snorted. "It is cold, genius. It's literally freezing, which explains all the hard stuff we're standing on."</p> <p>Lou elbowed him back. "Dork," she grumbled.</p> <p>He smirked at her.</p> <p>"The ice is just under ten inches here," Callum announced in his schoolteacher tone-the one that always made Lou want to act up like a contrary third-grader. "Is that thick enough for a group of people to walk on?"</p> <p>"Wouldn't it have been better to confirm that before we left shore?" Lou muttered, making Derek snicker. Callum sent a sharp look her way.</p> <p>"It's thick enough," Chad answered, taking a step toward Callum. "It'd even be okay to drive on it."</p> <p>"Drive what?"</p> <p>"A car or light truck," Chad said quickly. "For anything more, twelve inches would be better."</p> <p>"That's what she said," Derek whispered loud enough to make everyone except Callum laugh. Even Chad grinned before dropping his chin to hide it.</p> <p>Callum let his gaze fall on each person in turn. The chuckles died, replaced by awkward coughs.</p> <p>"So this ice is safe?" he finally asked when silence had fallen over the team members.</p> <p>"Yes." Chad was the first to speak up again, and Lou winced. He'd obviously already forgotten the four hours they'd spent watching training videos that morning.</p> <p>Wilt gave a slow, sad shake of his head. "No ice is safe," he said in the Arkansas drawl he held on to even after forty years in Colorado. Lou liked Wilt. He was a soft-spoken man who kept quiet unless he had something important to say. When he spoke, everyone shut up and listened. Wilt was in his sixties, with a thick mustache that drooped over his mouth, giving him a perpetually mournful expression.</p> <p>"Good, Wilt," Callum said. "Glad someone was paying attention this morning. We have to be especially careful of weak spots after the warm spell last week. Even though it's been cold the past couple of days, the ice probably hasn't recovered yet."</p> <p>Chad's shoulders sagged. Knowing all too well how it felt to be under the heavy weight of Callum's displeasure, Lou shot him a sympathetic glance. He avoided her gaze.</p> <p>"Okay!" Callum clapped his blue-gloved hands together. "Everyone in the water. First time in is the hardest, so it's best to get it over with."</p> <p>Lou eyed the water doubtfully, shuffling a little closer to the edge of the hole. She had a lot of scuba diving experience, but most of it had been in tropical locations. This was new to her.</p> <p>"What if my suit has a leak?" Chad asked. Lou whipped her head around to stare at him. Hell. She'd never thought about a leaky suit. Her newly panicked gaze flew to Callum's face.</p> <p>"Your suit is buoyant enough that it won't matter, even if it fills with water to your armpits." Callum waved a dismissive hand. "You'll still float."</p> <p>Slightly relieved but trying not to think about how freaking cold thirty-two-degree water up to her armpits would be, she turned her attention back to the opening in the ice. Derek had already taken the plunge.</p> <p>"C'mon in," he said, letting his legs float to the surface and leaning back as if he were in an easy chair. "The water's fine."</p> <p>Deciding to just get it done, Lou took a breath and jumped in. When her head went under, she instantly realized her mistake. Once the shockingly cold water hit her face, her lungs clamped down, squeezing out all her oxygen. She didn't even try to figure out which way was up but just let her suit float her to the surface instead.</p> <p>She felt a tap on the back of her hood and yanked her face out of the water. Callum was close enough for her to see the deep creases between his eyebrows.</p> <p>"You good?" he asked.</p> <p>"Y-yep."</p> <p>After examining her face carefully, he shook his head. "Never do anything halfway, do you, Sparks?"</p> <p>Since she didn't know if that was a compliment or an insult, she kept quiet. Her legs kept wanting to float to the surface behind her and tip her onto her front as the others climbed in more carefully. Scowling, she tried to force her lower half down but ended up flailing unsuccessfully.</p> <p>"How are you staying upright?" she asked Callum, craning her neck to keep her face out of the water as her legs headed for the surface again.</p> <p>"Tuck them to your chest and then push them straight down." He swam toward the icy ledge as she struggled to master her buoyant suit. She finally managed to shove her legs down so her body was more or less upright.</p> <p>"Ha!" she crowed, slapping the surface in victory. "Got you down, bitches!"</p> <p>"Did you just call your legs &#x2018;bitches'?" Derek asked from directly behind her, making her jump. Her upper body tilted forward, but she got herself back under control.</p> <p>"Yep. Occasional evidence to the contrary, I am in charge of all my body parts."</p> <p>"Glad to hear it."</p> <p>"Everyone out!" Callum bellowed, levering his body onto the ice with ease. "Exit the water on your front like a seal and then roll away from the edge. Remember, the more you can distribute your weight, the less likely it is you'll go through the ice."</p> <p>Lou flattened her hands on the ice and tried to hoist her body out of the water, but it looked a lot easier when Callum did it. Her legs, damn the rogue bastards, floated forward and up, catching under the ledge. She managed to slam the edge of the ice into her belly, driving out her breath.</p> <p>"Nice, Lou," Derek mocked as he slid gracefully onto the solid surface. "You're like a special seal."</p> <p>"Oh, shut up," she muttered, panting, as she hauled herself out of the water.</p> <p>This, she could tell, was going to be one hell of a day.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Sparks!" Callum bellowed. "You're up!"</p> <p>She sighed, relinquishing her spot on the rope where she'd been helping to pull the "victims" and their rescuers out of the water and across the ice. It was like a lopsided game of tug-of-war-all brute strength and teamwork-and she'd actually been getting to like that part of training, despite the hard work. But now that she wasn't pulling, she noticed her eyelashes had frosted over, and her neck and the top of her chest were clammy from the water that had leaked into the suit after her full-body plunge.</p> <p>Trudging over to Callum, she lifted her arms so he could wrap the end of the rope around her middle. Although she'd watched three of the guys perform an in-water rescue, she was still nervous. The ice-rescue veterans had made it look easy, but she had a feeling her first time wouldn't go so smoothly.</p> <p>Callum handed her the victim's harness, which looked like a skinny pool noodle. It was attached to her rope with about six feet of line. That way, the victim would be first out of the water, and she'd be behind him, in a position to help lift him onto the ice.</p> <p>"When you get to the victim, carabiner should be in your right hand," Callum instructed. "The other end goes in your left. Get control of your suit before trying to save anybody. Approach the victim from the side or back, talk to him, harness him up, signal the guys to start pulling, and lift your knee to help boost him onto the ice with your thigh. Once you get your hands on him, do not let go of your patient. Got it?"</p> <p>"Yes." Her voice sounded a little uncertain, so she firmed her jaw and tried again. "Yes."</p> <p>Callum's mouth quirked up on one side. If it had been anyone but Callum, Lou would've thought he was holding back a smile.</p> <p>Okay. Okay, she could do this.</p> <p>She approached the edge of the ice, crawling when she was ten feet out and then moving to her belly and sliding across the last yard. Swinging her legs around, she dropped feetfirst into the water, careful to keep her face above the surface this time. She looked back at where Callum stood on the ice. He bumped his closed fist on the top of his head, the signal for Are you okay? She answered in the affirmative with a matching fist-to-head bump before heading toward her "victim."</p> <p>Holding her face out of the water, she swam toward Phil, who clung to the ice on the other side of the opening with melodramatic panic. Lou had to bite back a groan when she saw how he was putting every ounce of community-theater experience into his role of drowning victim.</p> <p>Coming up next to him, she tried to get her legs underneath her as she spoke. "Hang on, sir. I'm Louise Sparks with the Field County Dive Team. We're going to get you out of here."</p> <p>Phil's pretend struggles increased, and his thrashing hand slapped the water, splashing it into her face. Air left her lungs again at the breath-stealing cold, and her legs floated up behind her. Damn it. When she could move her body again, she drew her knees up and pushed her feet straight down, glaring at her grinning victim.</p> <p>"Oops," Phil said. "Sorry, Lou."</p> <p>"Uh-huh," she muttered as she moved around behind him. "I'm hooking this harness around you, sir, so the team on shore can pull you out."</p> <p>She struggled to reach around Phil's wide girth, wishing she'd gotten skinny Wilt as her victim instead. The dry-suit gloves made her fingers thick and unwieldy, and she fumbled with the carabiner. To make matters even more silent-swear-worthy, Phil had resumed his melodramatic struggling.</p> <p>"Don't make me drown you," she snarled, jerking her head back so his flapping elbow didn't connect with her eye.</p> <p>"Where's your compassion, Lou? I'm a panicked, hypothermic tourist here." The bastard sounded as if he were about to laugh.</p> <p>"I'll show you compassion," she muttered through gritted teeth. "And if you're hypothermic, shouldn't you be getting tired and sluggish?"</p> <p>"That sounds threatening." Phil was definitely laughing, the ass. "As soon as you save me and I get out of the hospital, I'm going to file a complaint with your superior."</p> <p>"That's where you're wrong-there is no one superior to me," she said, letting out a relieved grunt when she finally succeeded in hooking the carabiner through the metal loop of the harness.</p> <p>Phil laughed and then wiggled several feet sideways, pulling his slick, neoprene-covered body free of her grip.</p> <p>"Never let go of your patient!" Callum yelled. "Once you put your hands on him, you do not let go until he is being lifted into the ambulance, understand?"</p> <p>With a heavy sigh, Lou tried to maneuver behind Phil again, but he was surprisingly agile for such a big guy. Plus, the training had been tiring, and she still had to help hoist Phil's bulk out of the water. Clenching her jaw, she lunged toward him, managing to latch her arms around his waist.</p> <p>"Got you!" she crowed, but her satisfaction was quickly overruled by irritation as her legs floated up behind her again, curving her spine into an awkward partial backbend. With Phil's body in the way, she couldn't pull her knees up very easily. After several unsuccessful attempts at getting her legs underneath her, she kicked out in frustration. But instead of passing through unresisting water, her booted foot hit hard against something.</p> <p>"What the hell?" she mumbled, looking over her shoulder. She couldn't see whatever i...</p></p><h2>Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga</h2><p>Replete with color photographs, drawings, and maps of Viking sites, artifacts, and landscapes, this book celebrates and explores the Viking saga from the combined perspectives of history, archaeology, oral tradition, literature, and natural science. The book&#39;s contributors chart the spread of marauders and traders in Europe as well as the expansion of farmers and explorers throughout the North Atlantic and into the New World. They show that Norse contacts with Native American groups were more extensive than has previously been believed, but that the outnumbered Europeans never established more than temporary settlements in North America.</p><p>In the early Middle Ages, driven by famine at home and the promise of wealth to be had in other lands, the Viking people exploded out of Scandinavia and set about conquering parts of England, Ireland, France, Russia, and even Turkey. Emboldened by their successes, the Vikings pushed ever farther outward, eventually crossing the North Atlantic and founding settlements in Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada.<p> In <i>The Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga</i>, some three dozen scholars examine the growing archaeological evidence of the Viking presence in the New World--including such items as a Norse coin excavated in Maine, runic stones from the Canadian Arctic, and farming implements found in Newfoundland. The contributors consider the sometimes friendly, sometimes warlike history of Viking interactions with the native peoples of northeastern North America (whom the Norse called <i>skraelings</i>, or "screamers"); compare the archaeological record with contemporary sagas and other records of exploration; and argue for the need to better document the Viking contribution to New World history.</p><p> "As an historical and cultural achievement," write the editors, "the Viking Age and its North American medieval extension stand out as one of the most remarkable periods in human history." This oversized, heavily illustrated volume celebrates that little-understood time. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>WILLIAM W.

Then he gave the genre a darkly compelling contemporary twist in his trilogy of the Word and the Void. Last year, in Armageddon&#x2019;s Children, Brooks undertook the stunning chronicle that united two unique worlds. Now that story of clashing forces of darkness and light, of Shannara&#x2019;s beginnings and the human race&#x2019;s possible end, marches forward into an unforgettable second volume full of mystery, magic, and momentous events.<br><br>Across the ruined landscape that is America&#x2013;hopelessly poisoned, plague-ridden, burned, and besieged by demon armies bent on exterminating all mortal life&#x2013;two pilgrims have been summoned to serve the embattled cause of good. Logan Tom has journeyed to desolate Seattle to protect a ragged band of street urchins and the being known as &#x201c;the gypsy morph,&#x201d; who is both mortal and magical, and destined to save mankind unless he is destroyed. Likewise, Angel Perez has her own quest, one that will take her from the wreckage of Los Angeles to a distant, secret place untouched by the horrors of the nationwide blight&#x2013;a place where the race of Elves has dwelled since before man existed. But close behind these lone Knights of the Word swarm the ravening forces of the Void. <br><br>As the menacing thunder of war drums heralds the arrival of the demons and their brutal minions in Seattle, the young survivors who call themselves the Ghosts are forced to brave the dangerous world of gangs, mutants, and worse to escape the invasion. And Logan Tom must infiltrate a refugee compound to rescue Hawk, the leader of the street urchins, who has yet to learn the truth about who and what he is. Meanwhile, Angel Perez has joined an equally urgent mission: to find the Ellcrys, a fabled talisman crucial to protecting the Elven realm against an influx of unspeakable evil from the dread dimension known as the Forbidding. But Angel and her Elf allies must beware&#x2013;for a demon spy, with a monstrous creature at its command, walks among them.<br><br>As the legions of darkness draw the noose tighter, and the time of confrontation draws near, those chosen to defend the soul of the world must draw their battle lines and prepare to fight with, and for, their lives. If they fail, humanity falls.</p><p><b>Terry Brooks</b>&nbsp;has thrilled readers for decades with his powers of imagination and storytelling. He is the author of more than thirty books, most of which have been&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers. He lives with his wife, Judine, in the Pacific Northwest.ONE<br><br>Logan Tom had climbed out of the lower levels of the compound and was starting up the steps to the walls when he heard the cries. They were sudden and sharp and signaled shock and excitement. He was still inside and could not tell what was happening, but he redoubled his efforts instantly, charging ahead, abandoning stealth, throwing caution to the winds.<br><br>If he was too late . . .<br><br>If they had already thrown Hawk and Tessa from the walls . . .<br><br>If, if, if!<br><br>The words burned in his mind like live coals. He couldn&#x2019;t be too late. Not after coming so far and getting so close. He should never have left Hawk in the compound. He should have found a way to take him out when he had the chance. Relying on breaking him free now was a fool&#x2019;s game, and anyone with an ounce of common sense would have known it!<br><br>He was running hard, his black staff held ready in front of him, his concentration complete. He passed dozens of the compound&#x2019;s inhabitants on the way up, but while a few turned to look, no one tried to stop him. Maybe they could see in his eyes that getting in his way for any reason was a bad idea. If what he was thinking was reflected there, mirrored in eyes that were hard-edged and enraged, they couldn&#x2019;t miss it.<br><br>He was up the steps all the way now and outside, the sports field spread away below him. The spectator seats in this section had been ripped out long ago to provide space for makeshift housing, and he found himself in a cluster of small one-level cottages built out of bricks and wood that were cobbled together to form rooms and stacked from one level to the next. They registered in his mind as he tore through them, following the lanes purposely left clear for passage, charging upward toward the top.<br><br>But something unexpected was happening. Those gathered on the walls to watch the death sentence on Hawk and Tessa being carried out were rushing back down almost as fast as he was rushing up. He stopped where he was, bracing himself against the swarm, trying to pick out something that made sense from the babble of words being exchanged.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . nothing ever like it before this, a demon&#x2019;s work if ever there was one&#x2014;did you see that light . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;. . . bright as a flare or maybe a . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;. . . wasn&#x2019;t a trace of them on the ground, and then it got dark again and you could see down . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Logan moved into the shelter of a narrow aisle made over into a walkway between huts, waiting for the way to clear. Whatever had happened, it was all over now. But what had happened?<br><br>He grabbed a young man who got close enough and pulled him out of the swarm of bodies. He put his face close. &#x201c;Tell me what&#x2019;s going on. Why is everyone running?&#x201d;<br><br>The young man stared at him a moment, seeing something that might have scared him even more than what he had witnessed on the wall. He tried to speak and couldn&#x2019;t, then yanked his arm free from Logan&#x2019;s grip and threw himself back into the surging mass of the crowd.<br><br>Logan shifted his approach from the common lanes and began making his way upward between the huts in a less direct fashion. He went as quickly as passage would allow, dodging or knocking obstacles aside. Buckets, brooms, pots, and other cooking implements went flying, and shouts of anger from their owners followed after him. In another time and under different circumstances, he would have drawn more attention. But the majority of the compound population was either coming down off the walls or fighting to get to the front gates, anxious to see whatever was out there.<br><br>Not the boy, he prayed. Not the girl.<br><br>He reached the upper levels where the housing grew sparse and scattered, a concession to the winds and the chill that made living higher up less desirable. The smells of the population gave way to the odors of fish and seaweed floating off the water, and the darkness deepened as the fires and generator lights were left below. Up here, what few lights there were pointed outward toward the gates and the approach to the walls. He passed out of the tangle of huts and walkways, the bulk of the crowd gone past now, and moved along the high wall toward an opening that led out onto what was once the concession area.<br><br>He found more buildings here, the same makeshift huts, these mostly for storage, not living. A scattering of the compound&#x2019;s residents still remained on the wall, looking down over the rim. He chose a young girl standing with her back to him, her attention on whatever lay outside below the walls.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are the boy and girl?&#x201d; he asked, walking up to her.<br><br>She turned and stared at him. She was no more than fourteen or fifteen, her freckled face squinched up as if she had swallowed something unpleasant. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The boy and girl?&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;What happened to them?&#x201d;<br><br>She hesitated. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t you see?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t here. Tell me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, wow, what didn&#x2019;t happen! It was so amazing! They threw them&#x2014; the guards threw them off, together, you know. They flew right out into space like&#x2014;like scarecrows or sacks of sand. Then a light appeared all at once, a brilliant light. It came right out of nowhere and swallowed them up. When the light disappeared, they were gone, too.&#x201d;<br><br>She glanced over her shoulder and looked down at the rubble-strewn pavement as if to make certain. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like it. No one knows what happened.&#x201d; She turned back. &#x201c;I heard one man say it was demon magic! Do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Logan didn&#x2019;t know what he thought. &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Did the light seem to come from one of them&#x2014;from the boy, maybe?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. Her long, sandy hair rippled in the dim light, and she brushed strands of it from her eyes. &#x201c;No, it didn&#x2019;t come from anywhere. It just flared up out of thin air and surrounded them. You couldn&#x2019;t see them at all after that. Everyone just went crazy! It was wonderful!&#x201d;<br><br>He took a moment to consider what this meant. The most logical explanation was that Hawk&#x2019;s magic&#x2014;the wild magic of the gypsy morph&#x2014; had surfaced in an unexpected way. But if the girl was right, if it wasn&#x2019;t Hawk&#x2019;s own magic manifesting itself in some unknown way, then it had to have been an intervening magic. Yet where would such magic have come from? Had Hawk and Tessa been saved or tossed from the frying pan into the fire? He knew he wouldn&#x2019;t find the answer here.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, mister, do I know you?&#x201d; the girl asked him suddenly.<br><br>He shook his head. &#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You look familiar.&#x201d;<br><br>He peered down over the walls to the rubble below. Nothing, not even the feeders, was there now. Whatever had happened, it had disrupted their plans to absorb the combination of magic and life force expended by Hawk&#x2019;s death. All those feeders, he thought, gone in the blink of an eye.<br><br>The girl was leaning on the railing next to him, studying his face. She must have seen him when he&#x2019;d come to the compound earlier in the day. She would remember soon enough. It was time to go.<br><br>Suddenly her gaze shifted. &#x201c;Look at that. See all the lights out on the water? Like a million little fires or something.&#x201d;<br><br>He looked to where she was pointing, but what he saw that she couldn&#x2019;t were the feeders massed along the waterfront, a surging horde of smooth dark bodies writhing and twisting in an effort to get closer to whatever was approaching on the water. He looked beyond to the lights, hundreds of them, couldn&#x2019;t make any sense of it at first, and then heard the drums and went cold.<br><br>At almost the same moment a horn blew from somewhere farther down the walls of the compound, high up in a watchtower, a mournful wail that signaled danger in any language. Someone else had spotted the lights and, like Logan, knew what they meant.<br><br>He turned away from the girl. &#x201c;I have to go. Thanks for helping me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure. Weren&#x2019;t you here . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>He wheeled back, cutting short the rest of what she was going to say. It was an impulsive act, one born of frustration and despair. He was tired of people dying. &#x201c;Go find your parents and your brothers and sisters and anyone else you care about and get everyone out of here. Tell anyone you meet. Those lights come from boats carrying an army that will besiege this compound and eventually destroy it.&#x201d;<br><br>She started to speak, but he grabbed her shoulders and held her. &#x201c;No, just listen to me. I know what I am talking about. I know about this army. I have seen what it can do. Get out of here, right away, even if no one else will go with you. I know you don&#x2019;t want to, but do it. Remember what I said. If you stay, you will die.&#x201d;<br><br>He left her staring after him, her eyes wide, her face rigid with shock and disbelief. He had no further time for her, nothing more he could do for her. She would believe him or not. Probably not. They seldom did, any of them. They thought it was as safe as it could get inside the compounds. They thought it was so much more dangerous out in the open. None of them understood. Not until it was too late. It was why they were being wiped out. It was the reason the human race was being annihilated.<br><br>To his surprise, she came after him, grabbed his arm, and pulled him around. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not serious, are you? About what will happen? None of that&#x2019;s true, is it?&#x201d;<br><br>He studied her a moment. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s your name?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Meike,&#x201d; she answered uncertainly.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, listen closely to me, Meike. Everything I said is true. There are madmen on those boats. They were human once, men and women like those in this compound. But they&#x2019;ve shed their humanity to serve demons that intend to destroy us all. They kill humans or put them in slave camps. They&#x2019;ve done it everywhere, all across the country. They will do it here, too. The compound leaders think they can stand against them, think they are safe enough here behind their walls. But other compounds thought the same, and they all fell in the end. This one will fall, too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any parents or brothers or sisters,&#x201d; she said. She brushed at her long hair, her eyes filled with fear. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have anyone. I don&#x2019;t know what to do. Where should I go?&#x201d;<br><br>He wished suddenly he hadn&#x2019;t told her. All he had done was scare her half to death. Besides, it was one life. What difference did saving one life make to what was going to happen here? Even if telling her got her out of here, what did it matter? She would end up dying in the countryside instead of in the city, nothing more. He was suddenly furious with himself. That was his problem, trying to save people like her. He was wasting his time when what he needed to do was what he had come to do in the first place&#x2014;find the gypsy morph.<br><br>He gave her a quick glance and shook his head. &#x201c;Go anywhere away from the city. Go into the country. Look for others who might want to go with you. There&#x2019;s safety in numbers.&#x201d;<br><br>He turned away abruptly and started down the walkway for the stairs, intent on getting out of there before anyone realized who he was. Once he was identified, things would become considerably more complicated.<br><br>&#x201c;Mister!&#x201d; she called after him.<br><br>He ignored her, moving faster now, hurrying deliberately to get away, reaching the stairs and descending them two at a time. The crowds had dissipated. He could hear them at the gates below, milling about in confusion as the watchtower horn continued to sound its warning. Already, squads of defenders were forming up in the parade grounds at one end of the field, soldiers carrying weapons, buckling on light armor and belts of ammunition. Well trained and organized, they would go out to meet the threat. They would try to stop the invaders at the docks, to prevent them from landing. They would fail, and then retreat through the streets to the compound, where they would feel safe. They would not be safe; they would be doomed. But it had nothing to do with him. The fighting at the docks and in the streets would last through the night. By tomorrow, he would be far away.<br><br>He glanced ahead at the clusters of compound inhabitants, choosing his path. He would go back down to the lower levels and out through the underground passageway. Panther would be waiting, and together they would find the other Ghosts and decide where to go to get away from what was about to happen.<br><br>But how in the world, he wondered, was he going to find out what had become of Hawk?<br><br>He turned down out of the arena and into the building interior and ran right up against a squad of compound defenders coming out.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold it right there,&#x201d; one said, and he pointed his weapon at Logan.<br><br>Panther hunkered down in the rubble at the edge of Pioneer Square, waiting impatiently. An awful lot had happened since Logan Tom had gone into the compound, and most of it was a mystery to him. He had carried out his assignment, going to the front gates and providing the diversion that Logan needed. He had done a good job of it, yelling up at the guards, demanding that Hawk be freed, that he be allowed to talk to him, that they give him food. He had made it look like he was a half-crazed street kid, and he must have succeeded because the guards on the walls laughed at him. After he&#x2019;d shouted at them for what he thought was twice as long as necessary for Logan to sneak past them to where the old transportation shelter would give him access to the compound, he had backed off and returned<br><br>to the spot where he&#x2019;d been told to wait, finding a place to hide and settling in.<br><br>For a long time, nothing had happened. Then he had seen the flash of light at the gates and heard the cries of those gathered on the walls, but he didn&#x2019;t know what it meant. He thought about moving to a better position, one closer to the gates, in an effort to find out. But he was worried that if Logan Tom returned with Hawk and couldn&#x2019;t find him, he might leave him behind. So he stayed where he was, frustrated and edgy. Night deepened until only a pale gray light remained in the western sky and the lights of the compound began to switch on. More time passed, and he found himself increasingly unsettled.</p><h2>Rachel Carson: Witness for Nature</h2><p>Rachel Carson&#39;s Silent Spring, published in 1962, did more than any other single publication to alert the world to the hazards of environmental poisoning and to inspire a powerful social movement that would alter the course of American history. This definitive, sweeping biography shows the origins of Carson&#39;s fierce dedication to natural science--and tells the dramatic story of how Carson, already a famous nature writer, became a brillant if reluctant reformer. Drawing on unprecendented access to sources and interviews, Lear masterfully explores the roots of Carson&#39;s powerful connection to the natural world, crafting a &#34; fine portrait of the environmentalist as a human being&#34; (Smithsonian).</p><p>Environmental historian Linda Lear does justice to the tragic dimensions of Rachel Carson's life in her prologue, which shows the author of <i>Silent Spring</i>, even as she was dying of cancer, testifying calmly before a congressional subcommittee whose investigation of the dangers of pesticides were prompted by her book. Lear portrays Carson (1907-1964) with affection and discernment as a remarkable woman who overcame prejudice against female scientists and aroused post-World War II America to the beauties of nature and the technological threats against it in a series of deservedly popular books.Linda Lear is the editor of <i>Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson</i>. She was consultant to the PBS television documentary "The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson" for The American Experience, and is a founder of the Lear/Carson archive at Connecticut College.

The bold aim of this book is to make manifest the origins, purpose, and interests of the emerging class responsible for making this new world--for producing the new concepts, new perceptions, and new sensations out of the stuff of raw data. </p><p> </p><p> <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> deftly defines the fraught territory between the ever more strident demands by drug and media companies for protection of their patents and copyrights and the pervasive popular culture of file sharing and pirating. This vexed ground, the realm of so-called "intellectual property," gives rise to a whole new kind of class conflict, one that pits the creators of information--the hacker class of researchers and authors, artists and biologists, chemists and musicians, philosophers and programmers--against a possessing class who would monopolize what the hacker produces. </p><p> </p><p> Drawing in equal measure on Guy Debord and Gilles Deleuze, <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> offers a systematic restatement of Marxist thought for the age of cyberspace and globalization. In the widespread revolt against commodified information, McKenzie Wark sees a utopian promise, beyond the property form, and a new progressive class, the hacker class, who voice a shared interest in a new information commons. </p></p><p><b> McKenzie Wark</b> is Professor of Cultural and Media Studies at Eugene Lang College and of Liberal Studies at The New School for Social Research. He is the author of several books, most recently <i>The Beach Beneath the Street</i>.What Ken Wark's book does is take us deep into the philosophy of hacking: it gives us a new way of seeing those irreverent folks who play for keeps with digital culture. Think of his book as a lexicon that says "play with digital culture like you would play with DNA--carefully." It's not every day that you get a book that takes you deep into the realm of practical analysis of the ways that we abstract thought and action in search for more kicks on-line, and for almost all aspects of control in digital culture from the top down "Hacker Manifesto" says--this is about exploration, this is about freedom. Inside out, upside down, information always wants to be free, and this is the book that shows us why. (Paul D. Miller a.k.a. Dj Spooky that Subliminal Kid author of <i>Rhythm Science</i>)<br><br>Ours is once again an age of manifestos. Wark's book challenges the new regime of property relations with all the epigrammatic vitality, conceptual innovation, and revolutionary enthusiasm of the great manifestos. (Michael Hardt, co-author of <i>Empire</i>)<br><br><i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> is a highly original and provocative book. At a moment in history where we are starved of new political ideas and directions, the clarity with which Wark identifies a new political class is persuasive, and his ability to articulate their interests is remarkable. (Marcus Boon, author of <i>The Road of Excess</i>)<br><br>McKenzie Wark's <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> might also be called, without too much violence to its argument, <i>The Communist Manifesto 2.0</i>. In essence, it's an attempt to update the core of Marxist theory for that relatively novel set of historical circumstances known as the information age. (Julian Dibbell, author of <i>Play Money: Diary of a Dubious Proposition</i>)<br><br>[Wark's] ambitious <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> Googles for signs of hope in this cyber-global-corporate-brute world of ours, and he fixes on the hackers, macro-savvy visionaries from all fields who 'hack' the relationships and meanings the rest of us take for granted. If we hackers--of words, computers, sound, science, etc.--organize into a working, sociopolitical class, Wark argues, then the world can be ours. (Hua Hsu <i>Village Voice</i> 2004-09-13)<br><br>Writers, artists, biotechnologists, and software programmers belong to the 'hacker class' and share a class interest in openness and freedom, while the 'vectoralist' and 'ruling classes' are driven to contain, control, dominate, and own. Wark crafts a new analysis of the tension between the underdeveloped and 'overdeveloped' worlds, their relationships to surplus and scarcity, and the drive toward human actualization. (Michael Jensen <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> 2004-09-24)<br><br>Infuriating and inspiring in turn, <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> will spawn a thousand theses, and just maybe spawn change. (Mike Holderness <i>New Scientist</i> 2004-10-23)<br><br>McKenzie Wark's <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> is a remarkable and beautiful book: cogent, radical, and exhilarating, a politico-aesthetic call to arms for the digital age...Whether or not <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> succeeds in rousing people to action, it's a book that anyone who's serious about understanding the changes wrought by digital culture will have to take into consideration. (Steven Shaviro <i>Resource Center for Cyberculture Studies</i> 2004-12-01)<br><br>McKenzie Wark's aptly named and timely <i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> is a remarkably original and passionate clarion call to question the increasing commodification of information in our digital age. The book is elegantly designed and written in a highly aphoristic style that evokes the grand essay tradition of Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Friedrich Nietzsche...<i>A Hacker Manifesto</i> is indispensable reading for anyone who wishes to understand the multiplying complexities of digital culture. It is itself an example of hacking: forging a new world out of the ruins of the present one. (John Conomos <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> 2004-11-27)<br><br>The larger argument may not be novel (it's plagued by the same flaws as Marx's original utopian blueprint), but this updated version of that vision provides a clever repudiation of the commodification of art, ingenuity, and the creative impulses--and a useful lens through which to examine the complexities involved in the ownership of ideas in this digital age.

The text, under the editorship of Stephen Jay Gould, provides a thorough understanding of the latest research and is accompanied by paintings prepared especially for this book. Never before has our planet's evolution been so clearly, so ingeniously explained. History is marked by disaster. The Book of Lifeexplains how mammals, having survived at least one of these disasters&#x2015;the impact of a massive comet&#x2015;luckily inherited the earth. Next came the rise of modern humans, who would shape the world as no creature has. As this fascinating history unfolds, gorgeous illustrations allow us to observe climate changes, tectonic plate movement, the spread of plant life, and the death of the dinosaurs. We discover the chains of animal survival, the causes and consequences of adaptation, and finally the environmental impact of human life. Color illustrations throughout.</p><p>An unusual scientific reference work by any measure, <i>The Book of Life</i> opens with an unusual protest from its editor, Stephen Jay Gould, who worries that it may have left out much of importance discovered between the present and the book's original publication in 1993. Gould's worry is well placed--in the last few years, many advances have been made in taxonomy and genetics, to name just two areas. Still, the book is a lucid, readily comprehensible, and largely up-to-date overview of the origins and evolution of life on earth, from the emergence of bacteria 4 billion years ago to that of Homo sapiens in recent geological time. Written by distinguished scientists, the text proceeds chronologically, giving an in-depth account of the fossil record. It is matched by hundreds of paintings, drawings, charts, and graphs that reinforce the authors' discussions.<p> More than all that, <i>The Book of Life</i> is a manifesto proclaiming the essential correctness of evolutionary theory, which has come under fire in places like Afghanistan and Kansas. "Life has changed through time," paleontologist Michael Benton observes. "No other explanation will account for the sequence and variety of the life forms preserved as fossils, or the history recorded since humankind began to draw, paint, and carve, about 30,000 years ago." The book's careful documentation of those changes makes it a highly useful reference for high school and university students, and it's a book that rewards casual browsing as well. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Stephen Jay Gould (1941-2002) was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Geology at Harvard University.

These questions form the core of a vast amount of philosophical reasoning. In his <i>Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals,</i> Immanuel Kant developed a basis for the answers.<br>In this landmark work, the German philosopher asks what sort of maxim might function as a guide to appropriate action under a given set of circumstances. By universalizing such a maxim, would morally permissible behavior not become clear? Suppose that everyone were to behave in accordance with this maxim. If everyone followed the maxim in the same way without harm to civilized culture, then the behavior would be morally permissible. But what if no one followed the maxim? Would civilization thereby be at risk? In such a case, the behavior would be morally obligatory.<br>Kant's test, known as the Categorical Imperative, is a logical proof of the Golden Rule and the centerpiece of this work. It constitutes his best-known contribution to ethical discussion, and a familiarity with his reasoning in this book is essential to students of philosophy, religion, and history.</p><p>Immanuel Kant</p><h2>The Captured Bride: Daughters of the Mayflower - book 3 (Volume 3)</h2><p><b>Mercy Lytton, a scout with keen eyesight raised among the Mohawks, and Elias Dubois, a condemned traitor working both sides of the conflict, must join together to get a shipment of gold safely into British hands.</b><br><i>A brand new series for fans of all things related to history, romance, adventure, faith, and family trees. </i><br><br><b><i>A War-Torn Countryside Is No Place for a Lady</i></b><br> Mercy Lytton is a lady like none other.

After the revolutionary novelist's death in the fall of 2001, one of his closest friends, acclaimed writer Ed McClanahan, decided to carry out Kesey's vision and put together a final issue of <i>Spit</i> as a tribute to Kesey's genius and imperturbable spirit. Featuring contributions from cultural luminaries-including Robert Stone, Paul Krassner, Wendell Berry, Bill Walton, and Grateful Dead lyricists Robert Hunter and John Perry Barlow-as well as "regular folk," and several pieces by Kesey himself, <i>Spit in the Ocean #7</i> is a loving and fitting homage to the gigantic and unique spirit of the merriest of the Merry Pranksters.</p><p>Ed McClanahan is an author and professor of writing whose best-known books include <i>Famous People I Have Known</i> and the novels <i>The Natural Man and Congress of Wonders</i>.Dedicated to the memory of the acclaimed author of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, this last volume of a literary magazine begun by Ken Kesey in 1973 "aspires to...constitute, in sum, an intimate, affectionate portrait of its founder, one which both honors him and bids him a fond farewell." In keeping with Kesey's original objective that every issue should have a different theme and editor, this one focuses on the project's creator and is edited by his friend of many years. Kesey's intellect, compassion and creative spirit appear in this work through some of his own original writings, as well as through the literature of numerous cultural figures with whom he interacted and whom he influenced. Included are letters, previously unpublished radio interviews, poems, essays, stories and anecdotes, all of which resuscitate the eclectic writer and bring him "to the page alive and hale and shooting from the lip as only he could."

The book explores the consequences in the soil of applications of superphosphate and other artificial fertilisers over decades, and explains soil chemistry in terms that every farmer can understand. It describes the exact role of each mineral and vitamin, both in the soil and in the body. And it explains how to prevent expensive disease outbreaks and minimise the use of costly artificial sprays and fertilisers. </p><p>The prescriptions are simple and can be applied to any farming enterprise market gardens, orchards, broadacre crops and pasture to restore the natural balance and fertility of the land, improve soil health, and increase productivity. The book is enlivened with accounts of spectacular successes in regenerating degraded land and curing animals that, in many cases, had been given up for dead. </p><p><i>Natural Farming</i> is an essential handbook for any farmer, with detailed information on: </p><p> <i> understanding a soil analysis; </i> establishment and management of pasture; <i> treatment of compacted soil and erosion; </i> alternatives to artificial fertilisers, herbicides, and pesticides; <i> the significance of weeds; </i></p><li><i> strategies for drought; </i> diagnosis of diseases and deficiencies in stock; <i> remedies for common diseases, including Johne's disease and immune-system disorders; and </i>rearing orphan animals. </li> <p><i>Natural Farming</i> equips the farmer to get the best from the land using environmentally sustainable methods that save time, expense, and worry &#x2015; and to supply the rising global demand for pure food.</p></p><p><p>Pat Coleby is Australia's foremost authority on farming without chemicals, and has written, published, and lectured widely on the subject.

In this virtuosic, career-spanning collection he takes on James Joyce and Elvis Presley, Nabokov and English football, Jane Austen and <i>Penthouse</i> Forum, William Burroughs and Hillary Clinton. But above all, Amis is concerned with literature, and with the deadly cliches&#x2013;not only of the pen, but of the mind and the heart. <br><br>In<b> The War Against Clich�</b><i>, </i>Amis serves up fresh assessments of the classics and plucks neglected masterpieces off their dusty shelves. He tilts with Cervantes, Dickens and Milton, celebrates Bellow, Updike and Elmore Leonard, and deflates some of the most bloated reputations of the past three decades. On every page Amis writes with jaw-dropping felicity, wit, and a subversive brilliance that sheds new light on everything he touches.</p><p>In Martin Amis's <i>War Against Clich�</i>, a selection of critical essays and reviews published between 1971 and 2000, he establishes himself as one of the fiercest critics and commentators on the literature and culture of the late 20th century. (He has already established himself as one of the most controversial and original novelists writing in English with novels such as <i>Money</i> and <i>Time's Arrow</i>.) In his foreword to the book Amis ruefully admits that his earlier reviews reveal a rather humorless attitude towards the "Literature and Society" debate of the time. Yet this only adds to the fascination of the collection, as Amis gradually finds his critical voice in the 1980s, confirming his passionate belief that "all writing is a campaign against clich�." <p> In the subsequent sections of the book, this war leads to some wonderfully cutting and amusing responses to whatever crosses his path, from books on chess and nuclear proliferation to Cervantes' <i>Don Quixote</i> and the novels of his hero Vladimir Nabokov. Praise for his literary heroes is often fulsome: J.G. Ballard's <i>High-Rise</i> "is an intense and vivid bestiary, which lingers in the mind and chronically disquiets it." But his literary wrath is also devastating in its incisiveness: Thomas Harris's <i>Hannibal</i> is dismissed as "a novel of such profound and virtuoso vulgarity," while John Fowles is attacked because "he sweetens the pill: but the pill was saccharine all along." Often frank in its reappraisals (Amis concedes to being too hard on Ballard's <i>Crash</i> when reviewing the film many years later), some of the best writing is reserved for his journalism on sex manuals, chess, and his beloved football. <i>The War Against Clich�</i> will provoke strong reactions, but that only seems to confirm, rather than deny, the value of Amis's writing. <i>--Jerry Brotton, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"Irresistible. . . . The man's a genius with words. . . . Whatever Amis has to say about a book or a writer seems just right--and lip smackingly phrased." --<i>The Washington Post<br></i><br>&#x201c;Brilliant prose. . . .[Amis] proselytizes for talent by demonstrating it, by doing it. . . . He is a master.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Whatever the book, there is no one whose review of it you'd rather read than Amis's. His prose is always buzzing, so much so that he doesn't just review books, he rewrites them." --<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>"[Written] with intelligence and ardor and panache. . . . Speaks not just to a lifetime of reading but also to a fascination with individual writers mature." --<i>The New York Times</i><br><i><br></i></p><h2>Rowland Bingham: Into Africa's Interior (Christian Heroes: Then &amp; Now)</h2><p>The thought of a land with not one Christian and not one missionary haunted Rowland. Images of cannibals and slaves pushed away sleep, and the stranger's words "Are you prepared to go if God calls you?" echoed over and over as he turned in his bed. Was he, Rowland Bingham, willing to go to the Sudan, where white men nearly always died?<br><br>At age twenty Rowland Bingham committed hiself to serving not only in Africa, known as the white man's grave, but in Africa's Sudan interior, where few missionaried had ventured and those who did soon died of disease or retreated in defeat. <br><br>Experience missionaries told Rowland that his dream was impossible.

Extensive notes and citations from original sources will make this authoritative work an essentialreference for researchers and practitioners for years to come. Includes are appendices for tables of alphabetic symbolism, a list of authors, and a numeric dictionary of Greek words, which represents the largest collection of gematria in print. Index.</p><p>A landmark new work in its field, The Greek Qabalah uses extensive academic research to reach what some may consider to be a controversial conclusion -- that the literal Hebrew Qabalah actually has Greek origins. Drawn from a vast array of ancient authorities and archaeological evidence -- from Aristotle to Zosimus, from Pythagoras to St. Paul, from Egyptian papyri to graffiti at Pompeii -- Kieren Barry carefully documents the use of the alphabet in philosophy, religion, oracles, and magic in the ancient world. He takes you on a journey through history, from the dawn of the alphabet, to the late Byzantine Era, following the continuous evolution of alphabetic symbolism from the number-mysticism of Pythagoras, to the Greek philosophers, the Egyptian magicians of Alexandria, the Romans, the Gnostics, the early Church Fathers, the Neoplatonists, and the Jews. Special attention is also given to the topical use of the Qabalah in the Bible, Gnosticism, and in the recently discovered Nag Hammadi Codices.<p>Also included are appendices containing tables of alphabetic symbolism, a list of ancient authors, and a numerical dictionary of several thousand Greek words, which represents the largest collection of gematria or isopsephy yet available in print. The Greek Qabalah is a revolutionary work that will be of enduring interest to a wide range of readers, including students of ancient history and early Christianity, Qabalists, and modern magicians, for many years to come.</p>Restores the factual basis of alphabetic numerology and symbolism in order to provide an accurate background upon which to base the more popular studies of numerology, Qabalah, enneagram, divination, and similar topices of interest to new age readers.</p><h2>Desert Voices (Rise and Shine)</h2><p>On the hottest<br> summer afternoons<br> when desert creatures<br> look for shade<br> and stay close to the earth<br> and keep their voices low <br>I sit high on a cactus<br> and fling<br> my loud ringing trill<br> out to the sun... <br>So sings the Cactus Wren, one of the ten desert creatures that speaks for itself in the evocative and lyrical verses of <i>Desert Voices.</i> In both text and illustration, <i>Desert Voices</i> conveys a message of spirit and courage from the shy and quiet creatures of the beautiful desert land.</p><p>Ten desert creatures speak for themselves, and as they tell what it&#39;s like to be a jackrabbit, a tortoise, a buzzard, or a rattlesnake, they make it clear that the desert is their home, the only home they&#39;d ever want.Byrd Baylor lives and writes in Arizona, presenting images of the Southwest and an intense connection between the land and the people.

Leave Your Sleep features a daring and delightful selection, ranging from the beloved (e.e. cummings, Edward Lear, and Jack Prelutsky) to the undiscovered (the young Nathalia Crane). Natalie Merchant's brilliant musical renderings, selected from her highly praised album, share the stage with Barbara McClintock's richly imagined art to create a memorable reading, looking, and listening experience.</p></p><p><p>Natalie Merchant is a musician who for the past 30 years has been recognized as one of America's most gifted singer-songwriters.She lives in the Hudson Valley of New York.</p><p>Barbara McClintock has written and illustrated many distinguished books for young readers, including <i>Adele &amp; Simon</i>.

Initially, Merchant adapted the poems to music and released them as an album, also called Leave Your Sleep, in 2010. This picture-book version includes the CD (not available for review) and presents each of the featured poems, from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Land of Nod&#x201d; to Jack Prelutsky&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bleezer&#x2019;s Ice Cream&#x201d; and Ogden Nash&#x2019;s &#x201c;Adventures of Isabel.&#x201d; According to Merchant&#x2019;s introduction, the project, which took five years to come to fruition, was based on a desire to teach her daughter &#x201c;that speech could be the most delightful toy in her possession and that her mother tongue is rich with musical rhythms and rhymes.&#x201d; McClintock&#x2019;s wonderfully precise illustrations brim with charm, presenting the rich imagery of the poems in full-page images or through a series of small, whimsical spots. A nice collaboration between two stars in their own fields that should lure children even deeper into the magical world of poetry. A photo gallery of the poets and music credits conclude. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Merchant&#x2019;s Leave Your Sleep (2010) album debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at number 17, Billboard Folk Albums at number 1, Amazon.com at number 1, and iTunes at number 3.

A tremendous testimony to the divine Authorship and reliability of the Scriptures.</p><p>Philip Mauro (1859-1952) stands out as one of the most captivating Christian writers of the Twentieth Century. For many years, he was a patent lawyer who argued cases before the United States Supreme Court, and he earned international recognition due to his successful handling of the French Artillery case against the U.S. Government, the Westinghouse Air Brake case, and other prominent cases. In 1903, at the height of his professional career, Mauro was converted to Christianity, and from that time forward, his chief occupation was the study of Scripture and the application of his keen intellect to biblical subjects. Initially embracing the Dispensational views propagated by the popular Scofield Reference Bible in his early years as a Christian, Mauro wrote several books and pamphlets from that perspective until coming to the conclusion that the system was grossly erroneous, and even heretical in its basic presuppositions. Although the more blatant errors of classic Scofieldism were downplayed by later writers, enough of the original system&#39;s influence remains in the Dispensationalism of today to warrant continued study of Mauro&#39;s meticulous rebuttals. His other works include The Hope of Israel, The Gospel of the Kingdom, Evolution at the Bar, and his massive commentary on the Book of Revelation entitled, Things Which Must Soon Come to Pass.</p><h2>Watershed Discipleship: Reinhabiting Bioregional Faith and Practice</h2><p>This collection introduces and explores &#34;watershed discipleship&#34; as a critical, contextual, and constructive approach to ecological theology and practice, and features emerging voices from a generation that has grown up under the shadow of climate catastrophe. Watershed Discipleship is a &#34;triple entendre&#34; that recognizes we are in a watershed historical moment of crisis, focuses on our intrinsically bioregional locus as followers of Jesus, and urges us to become disciples of our watersheds. Bibliographic framing essays by Myers trace his journey into a bioregionalist Christian faith and practice and offer reflections on incarnational theology, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology. The essays feature more than a dozen activists, educators, and practitioners under the age of forty, whose work and witness attest to a growing movement of resistance and reimagination across North America. This anthology overviews the bioregional paradigm and its theological and political significance for local sustainability, restorative justice, and spiritual renewal. Contributors reread both biblical texts and churchly practices (such as mission, baptism, and liturgy) through the lens of &#34;re-place-ment.&#34; Herein is a comprehensive and engaged call for a &#34;Transition church&#34; that can help turn our history around toward environmental resiliency and social justice, by passionate advocates on the front lines of watershed discipleship.

America</h2><p><p>When Flemish engraver and publisher Theodore de Bry issued the first volume of his America series in 1590, the New World was, for most Europeans, truly novel. Gleaned from the travel accounts of adventurers like Thomas Harriot, Sir Francis Drake, and Sir Walter Raleigh, De Bry&#x2019;s magnificent engravings brought the new continent and its inhabitants to an enraptured audience across the Atlantic.</p><p>From &#x201c;Virginia&#x201d; (today&#x2019;s North Carolina) and Florida through Central America and down into Patagonia, the first nine volumes of America depict scenery and encounters between native Americans and Europeans, revealing the latter&#x2019;s perceptions of the former. Portrayals of European discovery and native American customs were based on the explorers&#x2019; reports as well as De Bry&#x2019;s own imagination, he himself never having traveled to the New World. Although based in Frankfurt, De Bry laid the foundations of the series while in London, collaborating with artists John White and Jacques Le Moyne, whose original watercolors he adapted for the opening two volumes. With his sons, De Bry formed a family enterprise known for exquisite copper engravings and high-quality illustrations unrivaled in their mastery.</p><p>The legacy of America is profound, coloring Europe&#x2019;s earliest visions of the Atlantic world. Countless European illustrations would, throughout the following centuries, draw inspiration from the spectacular collection. TASCHEN&#x2019;s edition pays homage to De Bry&#x2019;s finesse, reprinting all 218 plates from the first nine volumes alongside their respective frontispieces and continental maps. Volumes I to VI are based on the original hand-colored editions held at the John Hay and John Carter Brown Libraries at Brown University in Providence; volumes VII to IX are from the Staats- und Stadtbibliothek in Augsburg, Germany.Exceptionally rare even at the time of their completion, De Bry&#x2019;s hand-colored America can finally be admired by all, in XXL resolution.</p></p><p>Michiel van Groesen is Professor of Maritime History at Leiden University, the Netherlands.

Deborah Lipsky takes a practical look at what happens when things spiral out of control, exploring what leads to meltdowns and tantrums, and what can be done to help. Drawing on her own extensive personal experience and using real-life examples to explain how autistic people think, the author distinguishes between meltdowns and tantrums, showing how they are different, how each can begin, and most important, how to identify triggers and prevent outbursts from happening in the first place.

Wright has published over a dozen works of poetry and prose, including the recent volumes One With Others, which was nominated for a National Book Award, One Big Self: An Investigation, and Rising Falling Hovering. Among her many honors are the Robert Creeley Award, the Griffin Poetry Prize, and a MacArthur Fellowship. She teaches at Brown University and lives outside of Providence, Rhode Island.<br><br>In 1969, a Tennessean known as "Sweet Willie Wine" led a small group of African-American men on a "walk against fear" through small-town Arkansas. This event grounds Wright's most recent blending of poetry and investigative journalism. A tribute to Wright's mentor--an autodidact, activist, and bourbon-swilling mother of eight, whose support for the march ("I would have followed Sweet Willie Wine into hell") made her "a disaffiliated member of her race"--the book probes the limits and intersections of the personal and the political. Wright intersperses descriptions of the Arkansas landscape; her own journey researching; transcriptions from V, her family, and others who experienced the events of that violent summer; lists of prices ("the only sure thing in those days"); the weather ("temperatures in the 90s even after a shower"), newspaper headlines; and personal memories. Through juxtaposition and repetition, she weaves a compelling, disturbing, and often beautiful tapestry that at once questions the ability of language to get at the complicated truth of history ("because the warp is everywhere"), and underscores the ethical imperative to try. As Wright learns from V, "To act, just to act. That was the glorious thing." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A tenuous teenage love affair fails to survive a hurricane; a man notices the women around him becoming progressively paler and smaller; a surgeon who specializes in hearts seems oddly emotionally opaque to his wife; a middle-aged couple&#x2019;s waning affection rekindles at the spectacle of rare Jamaican birds.

This book reveals the meaning behind the position of the planets in the nakshatras and shows how this energy connects to us and affects our thinking.

The democratic ideals of the CPE have aroused the implacable hostility of Cardinal Richelieu, effective ruler of France, who has moved behind the scenes, making common cause with old enemies to stop this new threat to the privileged and powerful. But the CPE is also working in secret. A group of West Virginians have secretly traveled to Venice where their advanced medical knowledge may prevent the recurrence of the terrible plague which recently killed a third of the city-state's population. At the same time, the group hopes to establish commercial ties with Turkey's Ottoman Empire, then at the height of its power. And, most important, they hope to establish private diplomatic ties with the Vatican, exploiting Pope Urban VIII's misgivings about the actions of Richelieu and the Hapsburgs. But a Venetian artisan involved with the West Virginians may cause all their plans to come to naught. Having read 20th century history books of the period, he has become determined to rescue Galileo from his trial for heresy. The Americans are divided on whether to help him or stop him-and whether he succeeds or fails, the results may be catastrophic for the CPE.</p><p><b>Eric Flint's</b> impressive first novel, <i>Mother of Demons</i> (Baen), was selected by <i>SF Chronicle</i> as one of the best novels of 1997.

By 1634, the West Virginians have established themselves, and their Confederated Principalities of Europe has joined forces with the king of Sweden. They have already altered history by their mere presence, but how far are they willing to go? William Dufris's strong narration is sprinkled with accents.

Contemporary feminism has re-embraced thinking about the big ideas - patriarchy, capitalism, care. But contemporary concern about men tends to relate to the men in our lives other than our fathers: our partners, friends, colleagues, bosses - many of whom are also, of course, fathers. Discontent with fathers has increasingly been privatised within feminist discourse. Daddy issues have been relegated to the realm of personal problems individuals take to therapists. In this bold, daring essay Katherine Angel asks: what is the fatherdaughter relationship today? How can it be understood politically? What political harms are done in the name of a father&#39;s love? Drawing on classic works by Virginia Woolf and Valerie Solonas along with more recent examples drawn from literature, film and TV, Angel examines how artists have conveyed the painful powers of the father in relation to the daughter.</p><p></p><h2>Tart of Darkness (Chef-to-Go Mysteries, 1)</h2><p><p>Right when Dani thinks she's hit a dead-end in her career, she unexpectedly inherits an enormous old house in a quaint college town.

He lives in Brookline, Massachusetts.In a well-researched, instructive, controversial analysis, Levine, a rabbi and director of Judaic Studies at Boston University, and Harmon, former editor of Boston's Jewish Advocate , show how forces external to the black and Jewish communities of Boston undermined their relationship. At issue: blockbusting in the Roxbury-Dorchester-Mattapan sections of the city, where the mid-1960s population of 90,000 Jews has been reduced to 2500. At fault, according to the authors, are: badly administered federal programs underwriting mortgage loans with little or no down payment to minority low-income and welfare families; local redevelopment agencies; profiteering realtors; establishment Jewry who, the book charges, abandoned working-class coreligionists; plus the consortium comprising Boston Banks Urban Renewal (B-BURG), which secretly established a boundary within the Jewish section as the only area in which insured mortgages would be granted, and only to blacks. B-BURG'S ribbon-cutting took place in 1968, and within three months 314 loans were made. By 1974, however, 50% of B-BURG purchasers had lost their homes through either foreclosure or abandonment, and the area developed its present alarming crime rate. Levine and Harmon present stories of harrassment, panic selling and violence, while singling out neighborhood Jews and blacks who tried to make integration succeed. The book brings a scandal to the docket, naming culprits and arguing a case that needs to be addressed--and not only in Boston. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Little Maid of Old Connecticut</h2><p>Here is the heroic story of Ellen Elizabeth Barlow, a little maid of Connecticut in 1776, when enemy war vessels and Tory bands were ravishing the coastal settlements.</p><p></p><h2>Discourse on Voluntary Servitude: Why People Enslave Themselves to Authority</h2><p><p>While short in words, <em>Discourse on Voluntary Servitude</em> speaks&nbsp;volumes to all those who value liberty on all levels, but who are&nbsp;currently trapped in the yoke of oppression by the many tyrants&nbsp;in every government and institution.&nbsp;This book may be considered the flip-side to Machiavelli&#x2019;s&nbsp;<em>The Prince</em>, which teaches would-be dictators how to acquire and&nbsp;maintain power over people and institutions.</p></p><p>"Everyone should read this short book to better understand the political situation we face today!" --Floyd Hurt (on Amazon.com)<br><br>"Thank you, William Garner, for bringing this goldmine of information back to life.

Brown, librarian at the Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Public Library, was summarily dismissed from her job after thirty years of exemplary service, ostensibly because she had circulated subversive materials. In truth, however, Brown was fired because she had become active in promoting racial equality and had helped form a group affiliated with the Congress of Racial Equality.</p> <p>Louise S. Robbins tells the story of the political, social, economic, and cultural threads that became interwoven in a particular time and place, creating a strong web of opposition. This combination of forces ensnared Ruth Brown and her colleagues-for the most part women and African Americans-who championed the cause of racial equality.</p> <p>This episode in a small Oklahoma town almost a half-century ago is more than a disturbing local event. It exemplifies the McCarthy era, foregrounding those who labored for racial justice, sometimes at great cost, before the civil rights movement. In addition, it reveals a masking of concerns that led even Brown&#x2019;s allies to obscure the cause of racial integration for which she fought. Relevant today, Ruth Brown&#x2019;s story helps us understand the matrix of personal, community, state, and national forces that can lead to censorship, intolerance, and the suppression of individual rights.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Louise S. Robbins</strong>, Associate Professor and Director, School of Library and Information Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, is author of <em>Censorship and the American Library: The American Library Association's Response to Threats to Intellectual Freedom, 1939-1969.</em></p>This little book is a major contribution to our understanding of library history and the core values of librarianship, but it is much more than that. It uniquely illuminates the way American society has used patriotism, loyalty, and the threat of communism to maintain and mask the subtle, even unwitting, racist and sexist agendas and traditions so deeply entrenched in our communities and their institutions. In 1950, Miss Ruth Brown was dismissed from her job as librarian at the Bartlesville Public Library, OK, a position she had held for 30 years, ostensibly because she had circulated such subversive and communist materials as the Nation, New Republic, and Soviet Russia Today. But many believed the real reason for her firing was due to her efforts to promote racial equality. This reviewer had heard about Brown and Bartlesville for decades. Thanks to Robbins (director, SLIS, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and author of Censorship and the American Library: The American Library Association!s Response to Threats to Intellectual Freedom, 1939$1969), one can finally understand what happened there and much more about America and librarianship. At the same time, the author introduces Brown!s story to a new generation of librarians unfamiliar with the case but who are now facing the [same] search for scapegoats, contests over cultural values, and the move by conservative groups touting family values! (rather than Americanism) to screen library materials. This title ranks with Jesse Shera!s classic Foundations of the Public Library in its historical insight and sweep. It also sheds revealing light on the reasons why our strong professional commitment to intellectual freedom has so frequently been blinded to or silent about our vulnerability to racial and gender injustice and inequity in our midst. We begin to know from Robbins who and why we librarians are what we are. We see the complexity of our value system and the imperative to articulate it more effectively to our public. The bonus here is Robbins!s epilog telling how she found the sources and conducted the research. It is academic detective work at its most thrilling. You owe it to yourself and your profession to make sure your library has this book, that you read it, and that you share it with your colleagues.

It has to do with changing the life of American society, from the inside out, through "source action" of prayer.<br><br> "I have written a book for Christians," says Eugene Peterson, "who want to do something about what is wrong with America and want to plunge into the center, not tinker at the edge. I have chosen eleven psalms that shaped the politics of Israel and can shape the politics of America, and I have taken them seriously...I have written to encourage Christians to pray them both as children of God with eternal destinies and as American citizens with daily responsibilities in caring for our nation."<br><br> Peterson is concerned with the "unselfing" of our self-preoccupied, self-bound society through the action of praying together with other believers. He offers insightful, thought-provoking reflections on eleven select psalm-prayers that can help us overcome such things as self-centeredness, self-assertiveness, self-righteousness, self-sufficiency, self-pity, self-service, and self-love.<br><br> Originally published under the title&nbsp;<i>Earth and Altar</i>&nbsp;and now being reprinted for wider distribution,<i>Where Your Treasure Is</i>&nbsp;provides solid fare for any thoughtful, concerned Christian. But the book is especially suitable for group study and discussion: what Peterson writes here will serve to stir small groups of Christians to pointed reflection and prayer-action.</p><p>Eugene H. Peterson was a longtime pastor and is professor emeritus of spiritual theology at Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia.

Joshua Greene was only looking for a hardworking, practical mail-order bride to help with the farm and feed and clothe his children. Yet from the moment Carrie saw his photograph, saw his devastatingly handsome, sorrowful smile, the petite and pampered beauty knew she was the perfect wife for him. <br> Josh didn't see it that way. Wed by proxy, he refused to be charmed by his new bride's blond curls and effervescent laughter, or impressed by her trappings of wealth...even if his son and daughter believed she was a fairy princess come to life. He was furious -- and ready to send her packing, until a near tragedy convinced him that her beauty was more than skin-deep. But even after he had yielded to the wild desire that surged between them, Josh could not admit how much he truly needed her. Then an old scandal threatened to re-emerge, and he realized that he could lose her forever....</p><p>Jude Deveraux is the author of&nbsp;more than forty <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including <i>Moonlight in the Morning</i>, <i>The Scent of Jasmine</i>, <i>Scarlet Nights</i>, <i>Days of Gold</i>,<i> Lavender Morning</i>, <i>Return to Summerhouse</i>, and <i>Secrets. </i>To date, there are more than sixty million copies of her books in print worldwide.

Had anyone else seen the cozy comfort of the house, they would not have guessed the wealth of the family that owned it. Only an art student would have been aware of the significance of the signatures on the paintings that hung from the plaster walls, or of the names on the bronze statues, and only a connoisseur would have recognized the value of the carpets that were worn and stained from years of use by dogs and children.<br><br>The furniture had not been selected for its worth but for the needs of a family that had occupied the house for a couple of hundred years. An antiquarian would have seen that the old cabinet against one wall was actually Queen Anne, the little gold chairs were Russian Imperialist, and the porcelains in the cabinet in the corner were Chinese and too old for the comprehension of the young American mind.<br><br>The house was filled with pictures and furniture and fabrics from all over the world, the accumulated haul of generations of Montgomery men and women's travels. There were souvenirs from every corner of the globe, ranging from exotic items from the tiny islands of the world to paintings by Italian masters.<br><br>Walking swiftly, with a long-legged stride, Jamie went from one room of the enormous house to the other. Twice he patted the little flannel sack that was carefully tucked under his arm, smiling each time he touched it.<br><br>At last he came to a door and, with only a soft knock that wasn't meant to be heard, he entered the darkened bedroom. For all that the rest of the house wore a tattered opulence, this room showed every cent of the Montgomery wealth.<br><br>Even in the dark, he could see the gleam of the silk bed hangings, draping the huge, four-poster bed that had been carved in Venice, the bedposts fairly dripping with carved and gilded angels. From the top of the bed hung hundreds of yards of pale blue silk, and the walls of the room were upholstered with a darker blue damask that had been woven in Italy and brought back to America on a Montgomery ship.<br><br>Looking down at the bed, Jamie smiled, for he could see a blonde head just above the silk-covered, down-filled coverlet. He walked to the windows, threw back the heavy velvet curtains to let sunlight into the room, then watched as the head snuggled deeper into the covers.<br><br>Smiling, he went to the bed and looked down at its occupant, but all he could see was one golden curl clinging to the sheet; the rest of her had disappeared beneath the covers.<br><br>Lifting the bag from under his arm, Jamie opened the drawstring and withdrew a tiny dog that weighed no more than eight pounds; what body it had could hardly be seen for the long, silky white hair that covered it. The dog was a Maltese, and he'd brought it all the way from China as a gift for his baby sister.<br><br>Slowly lifting the coverlet, Jamie put the little dog in the bed with his sister, then grinning in anticipation, he took a chair and watched as the animal began to move about and lick its bedmate.<br><br>Slowly, and with great reluctance, Carrie came awake. She always hated to leave the warm cocoon of her bed and put it off as long as she could. Now, she moved a bit, her eyes still closed as she flung the covers down about her shoulders. At the first lick of the little dog, she smiled, then smiled again at the second lick. Only at the tiny bark did she open her eyes, looked into the face of the creature, then sat up, startled, her hand to her throat. Leaning back against the headboard, a carved angel's wing tip poking her in the back, she looked at the dog, blinking in wonder.<br><br>It was the laugh of her brother that made her turn her head, and even then it took her a moment to understand what was going on. When the understanding came to her that her beloved brother had at last come home from the sea, she gave a squeal of delight, then launched herself at him, dragging silk coverlet and cashmere blankets with her.<br><br>Catching her in his strong sun-browned arms, Jamie whirled her about, while on the bed behind them the little dog yapped excitedly.<br><br>"You weren't due in until next week," Carrie said, smiling and kissing her brother's cheeks and neck and whatever she could reach of him.<br><br>Jamie, trying to act as though he weren't reveling in his sister's enthusiastic greeting, held her at arms' length, her feet off the floor. "And you would have been down at the wharf to greet me, no doubt, if you'd known when I was going to arrive. Even if I'd come in at four in the morning."<br><br>"Of course," she said, smiling at him, then, a concerned look on her face, she put her hand on his cheek. "You've lost weight."<br><br>"And you haven't grown an inch." Looking her up and down, he tried to put an older-brother expression on his face, but it wasn't easy to be stem when looking at Carrie's tiny exquisiteness. Carrie was five feet even, yet all her brothers were over six feet. "I was hoping you'd have grown until you at least reached my waist. How did Mother and Dad produce such a runt as you?"<br><br>"Luck," she said happily as she turned to look at the little dog, which was now standing on the bed, its pink tongue hanging out. "Is this my present?"<br><br>"What makes you think I brought you a present?" he asked reproachfully. "I'm not sure you deserve one. Did you know that it's ten o'clock in the morning and here you are still sleeping."<br><br>She wriggled her shoulders to make her brother put her down. Carrie's interest, now that she had seen that he was home and well, was in the pretty little dog. When her feet were once again on the floor, she went to the bed, and when she slid back into it, the dog at once came to her to be petted.<br><br>While Carrie's attention was on the dog, Jamie looked about the room, noting what had been added since the last time he had been home. "Where did this come from?" He held up a foot-tall ivory carving of an Oriental lady, beautiful and intricate.<br><br>"Ranleigh," Carrie answered, speaking of another of her brothers.<br><br>"And this?" Jamie nodded toward an oil painting framed in gold.<br><br>"Lachlan."<br><br>Looking up from the dog, Carrie smiled at her brother as though she had no idea what was causing him to frown. She had seven brothers, all of them older than she, all of them travelers, and every time they left the country they brought her back a present -- each gift more flawlessly beautiful than the one another brother had brought her. It was almost as though they competed with each other to see who could bring their little sister the most marvelous gift.<br><br>"And these?" Jamie asked, picking up a string of pearls from Carrie's dressing table. His voice was sounding downright prim.<br><br>Smiling enigmatically, Carrie picked up the little dog and hugged it, burying her face in its soft fur. "This is by far the nicest present I have ever received in my life."<br><br>"Did you tell Ranleigh that when he gave you the lady?" Jamie was sounding almost jealous.<br><br>As a matter of fact, she had told Ranleigh that his gift was the best, but she wasn't going to tell Jamie that. "What's his name?" she asked, speaking of the tiny dog and doing her best to change the subject.<br><br>"That's for you to decide."<br><br>As Carrie stroked the dog, it sneezed. "Oh, Jamie, he really is the very nicest gift I ever have received. He's so very alive."<br><br>When Jamie came back to his chair by the bed, she could tell by his face that he was somewhat mollified by her assertions that his gift was indeed the best. Smiling at her, he watched the way the sunlight touched her thick mass of dark blonde hair and the way her blue eyes glinted with pleasure as she played with the dog, and knew that she was quite the prettiest thing he'd seen in a long while. She was as small as her brothers were large, as sweet tempered as they were irascible, and as full of laughter as they were of anger. And she was as used to luxury as they were to work. Carrie was the spoiled, adored, darling baby of the large family, and any of her brothers would have killed anyone who even thought of harming her.<br><br>Jamie leaned back in his chair, for he was glad to be at home, glad to be no longer on a rolling ship. "What have you and the Ugly Horde been up to lately?"<br><br>"Don't call them that!" Carrie said, but without any real animosity. "They aren't ugly."<br><br>When Jamie grunted at that, Carrie smiled. "Not <i>too</i> ugly anyway, and, besides, what do looks matter?"<br><br>He grinned at that. "Nineteen years old and already a philosopher."<br><br>"I'll be twenty soon."<br><br>"My, my, such a great age."<br><br>Carrie didn't mind his teasing, for, to her, there was little that her brothers could say or do that was wrong. "Whatever our appearance" -- she generously included herself with the "Uglies" -- "the girls and I are involved in a very important project."<br><br>"I'm sure of it." Jamie's tone was patronizing, but adoring at the same time. "As important as saving the frogs from the giggers? Or making poor Mr. Coffin give his geese free running space?"<br><br>"Those projects were in the past. Now we're involved in -- " She broke off as the dog sneezed twice in succession. "You don't think he's catching cold, do you?"<br><br>"More likely he's reacting to all this silk. This place looks like a harem."<br><br>"What's that?"<br><br>"Something I'm not going to tell you about."<br><br>Carrie's lower lip protruded a bit. "If you ever want to give me a really spectacular gift, you could tell me, in detail, all that you've done on a voyage."<br><br>At the thought of what such a revelation would entail, Jamie looked a bit pale, and it took a moment before his color returned. Smiling, he said, "That's one gift you're not likely to receive from any of us. Now tell me what you and the Uglies have been doing."<br><br>"We're marrying people," Carrie said proudly then was pleased to see her brother's jaw drop in astonishment.<br><br>"You got someone to <i>marry</i> those ugly girlfriends of yours?"<br><br>She gave him a look of exasperation. "They aren't so ugly and you know it. And every one of them is as nice as can be. It's just that you think all women should be utterly and totally beautiful."<br><br>"Like my dear little sister," he said, and there was honesty in his voice as well as love in his eyes.<br><br>Blushing with pleasure, Carrie said, "You'll turn my head."<br><br>At that impossibility, Jamie whooped with laughter, causing the dog to start barking, then sneezing.<br><br>"Turn your head," he said. "As if you didn't already know that you're the most beautiful thing in five states."<br><br>Carrie gave a mock look of deep, deep hurt. "Ranleigh said six states."<br><br>Jamie laughed again. "Then I'll say seven."<br><br>"Much better," Carrie said, laughing. "I'd hate to lose a state. The seventh isn't Rhode Island, is it?"<br><br>"Texas," Jamie answered, and they smiled at each other.<br><br>As Carrie leaned forward, holding the little dog, Jamie thought that she and the animal already looked as though they belonged together, just as he knew they would when he'd purchased the puppy he could hold curled in one palm.<br><br>"Jamie, we really are marrying people to each other," she said earnestly, her face serious. "Since the War Between the States, there have been so many women who have lost their husbands, and in the West there are a great many men who need wives. We match them with each other. It's been very interesting work."<br><br>Blinking at her for a moment, trying to understand what she was telling him, Jamie sat there staring at her. Sometimes it seemed to him that of all the family, sweet, adorable Carrie was the most stubborn. When she decided to do something, she had tunnel vision: Nothing on earth could stop her. Thank heaven that, so far, all her causes had been worthy ones. "How do you find these people?"<br><br>"The women we have already, quite a few of them from here in Warbrooke, although we've had to let people in the rest of Maine know that we're providing this service, but the men have been found through newspaper advertisements."<br><br>"Mail-order brides," he said softly, his voice rising with each word. "You're doing mail-order brides, like in China. You've stuck your nose into other people's personal lives."<br><br>"I don't think it's nosiness exactly, more that we're providing a service."<br><br>"Matchmaking, that's what you're doing. Does Dad know you're doing this?"<br><br>"Of course."<br><br>"And he doesn't object?" Before Carrie could answer, Jamie spoke again. "Of course he has no objection. He's always allowed you to do whatever you wanted to do since the day you were born."<br><br>Stroking the tiny dog, Carrie smiled sweetly at her brother and fluttered her lashes a bit. "You aren't going to make any complaints, are you? Ranleigh didn't."<br><br><i>"He</i> spoils you," Jamie said, looking stern, but Carrie was still smiling at him, and he couldn't retain the look of severity on his face. "All right," he said with a sigh, knowing he'd lost his attempt at being strict, "so tell me more about this non-nosy matchmaking."<br><br>Carrie's delicate face brightened with eagerness. "Oh, Jamie, it's just lovely. We've had such a good time. I mean, we do enjoy ourselves while we perform this much-needed service, that is. We put advertisements in papers out West and say that if the men will send us a photograph of themselves -- we won't send anyone out unless we've seen the man, since a photograph tells so very much about a person -- and a letter explaining what they want in a wife, then we will try to match them up with a lady."<br><br>"And what are the women required to do?"<br><br>"They must come to us to be interviewed. We make cards listing their qualifications and then match them with a man." She gave a dreamy smile. "We make people very happy."<br><br>"How do these women get to the men?"<br><br>"Stagecoach, usually," she said, looking down at the dog. When Jamie didn't say another word, she looked back at him, her little chin set at a defiant angle. "All right, yes, Montgomery money pays their way, but it's for a good cause. These people are lonely, and they need each other so much. Jamie, you should read some of the letters from these men. They live all alone in places that no one has ever heard of, and they need company so much."<br><br>"Not to mention a good strong back to help work the farm as well as someone in their bed," he said, trying to interject a note of realism into her dreams of everlasting love.<br><br>"Well, the women need that too!" Carrie snapped.<br><br>"And what do you know of such things?"<br><br>He was teasing her, and she couldn't help being annoyed at his attitude. Most of the time she loved being pampered by her big brothers, but sometimes they could be a pain. "More than you and the others think that I do," she shot back at him. "In case you haven't noticed, I'm not a little girl any more. I'm a grown woman."<br><br>Sitting there in the tumble of silken bed clothes, her thick hair down about her shoulders, snuggling with the toylike animal, she didn't look over ten years old. "Yes," he said softly, "a grand old lady."<br><br>Carrie sighed. As much as she loved her brothers, she also knew them, and not one of them, or her father, wanted her to grow up. They wanted her to stay their adoring little sister whose only thoughts were for them.<br><br><i>"You</i> aren't trying to find a husband, are you?" Jamie asked, and there was alarm in his voice.<br><br>"No, of course not." She knew better than to tell any of the men in her family that she was someday planning to get married, for they all thought she was little more than a toddler.

"A devastating and wholly necessary book."&#x2015;Studs Terkel, author of <em>Working</em></strong></p> In <em>The Corrosion of Character</em>, Richard Sennett, "among the country's most distinguished thinkers . . . has concentrated into 176 pages a profoundly affecting argument" (<em>Business Week</em>) that draws on interviews with dismissed IBM executives, bakers, a bartender turned advertising executive, and many others to call into question the terms of our new economy. In his 1972 classic, <em>The Hidden Injuries of Class</em> (written with Jonathan Cobb), Sennett interviewed a man he called Enrico, a hardworking janitor whose life was structured by a union pay schedule and given meaning by his sacrifices for the future. In this new book-a #1 bestseller in Germany-Sennett explores the contemporary scene characterized by Enrico's son, Rico, whose life is more materially successful, yet whose work lacks long-term commitments or loyalties. Distinguished by Sennett's "combination of broad historical and literary learning and a reporter's willingness to walk into a store or factory [and] strike up a conversation" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>), this book "challenges the reader to decide whether the flexibility of modern capitalism . . . is merely a fresh form of oppression" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>, starred review). Praise for <em>The Corrosion of Character</em>: "A benchmark for our time."&#x2015;Daniel Bell "[A]n incredibly insightful book."&#x2015;William Julius Wilson "[A] remarkable synthesis of acute empirical observation and serious moral reflection."&#x2015;Richard Rorty "[Sennett] offers abundant fresh insights . . . illuminated by his concern with people's struggle to give meaning to their lives."&#x2015;[Memphis] <em>Commercial Appeal</em></p><p>In the brave new world of the "flexible" corporation, Richard Sennett observes, workers at all levels are regarded as wholly disposable, and they have responded in kind, ceasing to think in terms of any long-term relationship with the organizations they work for. This, he argues, has tremendous negative consequences for workers' emotional and psychological well-being. Even in menial jobs, we extract much of our self-image from the idea of a "career"--a life narrative rendered intelligible by specific loyalties, which is to some degree self-invented but also in some respects predictable. Innovations like "flextime" and bureaucratic "de-layering" seem to promise more freedom to define one's career, but in fact they create jobs in which there's less freedom than ever to be had. <i>The Corrosion of Character</i> is a short, anecdotal book, and while one might wish that it included a discussion of the social and psychological costs of the sheer increase of work time in the average worker's week, Sennett has created a pithy, disturbing picture of the cost of the corporate world's much-vaunted new efficiencies. <i>--Richard Farr</i>&#34;The Corrosion of Character&#34; was named one of the Top Ten Books of 1998 by Business Week magazine.</p><h2>After the Dancing Days</h2><p><p></p><strong>Is War A Thing To Be Forgotten?</strong><p>That's what Annie's mother would like to do.

There was no yard, except for a narrow strip of grass between the parking lot and the street. Nowhere to play. Her mother had been concerned about that, for though there was a park two blocks away, she did not want Katie to go there alone.<br> <br>So for the moment she sat on the balcony, looking through the iron bars that formed the sides of it, and watched the activity in the street.<br> <br>Katie had always lived in the country, and she had liked that. This seemed interesting, however, and it was a nice street. It was wide and shaded with big trees, and most of the time there wasn&#x2019;t a lot of traffic. Except when people were going to work, of course, the way they were now.<br> <br>She saw Miss Katzenburger emerge from the front door below and head toward the street. Katie hadn&#x2019;t met her yet, but she knew who she was. She&#x2019;d seen which apartment she went into&#x2014;3-B, one floor up&#x2014;and had looked at the nameplate beside the door.<br> <br>Miss Katzenburger had red hair and was quite pretty. Katie admired pretty people, like Miss Katzenburger and her mother; she wasn&#x2019;t pretty herself. Even if she hadn&#x2019;t had to wear horn-rimmed glasses, she knew that her face was plain. Her hair was an ordinary color, a sort of pale tan that was not quite blonde and not quite brown, and as straight as it was possible for hair to be. When she grew old enough to have a choice, she thought she might like to be redheaded, like Miss K. Or, her second choice, blonde like her mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Joy, wait a minute!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie pressed her face against the cold bars to see who was calling after Miss K. Oh, him.<br> <br>She had met Mr. Pollard. He lived in 3-A, right across from Miss K., and she&#x2019;d collided with him on the stairs last night, her first whole day at The Cedars Apartments. He had dropped some papers he was carrying, and Katie had stepped on them, after which he had sworn at her. And then, when she had said nothing except, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; and stared at him, Mr. Pollard quickly snatched up his papers and edged around her, almost running the rest of the way down.<br> <br>The way people often ran away from her, Katie thought. She&#x2019;d wondered if it would be different in the city from the way it had been at home, near Delaney. Oh, they didn&#x2019;t always run, exactly, but when they looked into her face they often backed away, muttering things she couldn&#x2019;t understand, and hurried in some other direction.<br> <br>Mr. Pollard, who was nearly bald on top even though he wasn&#x2019;t very old yet, didn&#x2019;t see her now. He caught up with Miss K., and their voices carried clearly to the little balcony over their heads.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I&#x2019;ve missed my bus; could you give me a lift?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Miss K. agreed. She had a nice voice. &#x201c;I have to pick up my girl friend, Angie, on the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s OK. Just so I get downtown. I had to stay up for hours last night, redoing all those papers that brat walked on, and I overslept.&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie tightened her fingers on the bars. It had been just as much his fault as hers that they&#x2019;d run into each other; he had been running, too. Why were so many things her fault?<br> <br>They had stopped, just a few yards out from the front edge of the balcony; she could see the tops of their heads, one a beautiful mass of red-gold curls, the other with a few strands of hair combed across the bald spot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute, have I got my keys?&#x201d; Miss K. dug around in her handbag. &#x201c;What brat are you talking about? The little girl in 2-A? I thought she looked like a cute little owl, with those glasses. The quiet type. I doubt if she&#x2019;ll be any trouble. Oh, here they are!&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. held the keys up, jingling them. Katie always thought of people by their initials; it was easier, especially when they had names like Katzenburger. Mr. P. shifted his briefcase to the other hand. &#x201c;Did you look at her? At her eyes?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. stopped jingling the keys. &#x201c;No. What about them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re silver. And they&#x2019;re weird, she&#x2019;s a weird kid.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Silver eyes?&#x201d; Miss K. looked at him more closely. &#x201c;Mr. Pollard, you haven&#x2019;t been drinking, have you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not! Look at the kid the next time you see her&#x2014;she&#x2019;s got funny eyes, I tell you! And I thought you were going to call me Hal.&#x201d;<br> <br>They started walking toward the cars in the parking area. Miss K. owned a light blue Pinto; Katie had seen her get out of it yesterday afternoon.<br> <br>They were almost there when Mr. P. gave a howl of mingled pain and rage, and doubled over, grabbing for his ankle. Then he turned and looked back toward the building.<br> <br>His eyes met Katie&#x2019;s, and there was fear and anger in them. He swore again, loudly enough so she could hear it. &#x201c;I told you, there&#x2019;s something strange about that kid. I nearly broke my ankle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. stared at him in amazement. &#x201c;Well, I can see that, but what did she have to do with it? You tripped over a rock!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah! Yeah, I got hit in the ankle by a rock that wasn&#x2019;t there a few minutes ago. It just sort of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sort of slid right out in the middle of the sidewalk and smacked me!&#x201d;<br> <br>He was still glaring at Katie as he rubbed at his injured ankle, hopping on one leg, then balancing himself against a light post.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for heaven&#x2019;s sake! You can&#x2019;t possibly be blaming a child for that?&#x201d; Miss K. unlocked the car door and regarded him in exasperation.<br> <br>&#x201c;There wasn&#x2019;t any rock on the sidewalk a minute ago, was there? Did you see it, a minute ago? Did you ever see a rock on the sidewalk before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; Miss K. admitted. &#x201c;But they&#x2019;re all around the edges of the flower beds; something must have knocked one loose.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Mr. P. demanded. &#x201c;What was near it? It moved just now, just in time to connect with my ankle bone! And she&#x2019;s up there, watching us.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss K. lifted her gaze to the second floor balcony. For a moment their eyes locked over the distance between them. Katie&#x2019;s face didn&#x2019;t change expression. She could see Miss K. thinking it over, and then she said, &#x201c;She&#x2019;s only a cute little girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute? Are we talking about the same kid?&#x201d; Mr. P. turned and stared at her too, angry and baffled. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how she does it, but there&#x2019;s something about her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, if you want a ride with me, come on,&#x201d; Miss K. said, and they got into the Pinto and drove away.<br> <br>Katie sat watching two men from the apartment house across the street, men who didn&#x2019;t pay any attention to her. And then she remembered the rock that was still in the middle of the sidewalk, and she stared at it, very hard, until it began to move. It slid slowly at first, and then, as Katie&#x2019;s power built up with increased effort, it spurted off the rest of the way and lodged somewhat crookedly in the edge of the flowerbed.<br> <br><br> <br>Katie had known, long before she learned that by thinking about moving things she could actually move them, that she was different from other kids. She knew it partly because the adults around her said so.<br> <br>She had lived with her mother and father until she was nearly four, and she remembered that, though they had both been kind and affectionate, they had sometimes been puzzled by her behavior.<br> <br>&#x201c;She never cries!&#x201d; Monica Welker had said, on more than one occasion, when Katie was listening. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want a fussy baby, but even when she was only an infant, she never cried! At first I was terrified that there was something wrong with her&#x2014;mentally, I mean. It wasn&#x2019;t long before we could see that wasn&#x2019;t so&#x2014;and then she went almost too far the other way. I mean, Katie&#x2019;s so bright that sometimes she frightens me!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie, considering that, thought Monica rather confused. First she was afraid her baby was retarded, and then was equally afraid because she was intelligent.<br> <br>She had, when she was little, called her parents Mama and Daddy. But now Monica didn&#x2019;t seem like her mother at all. Her parents had gotten a divorce when she was three, almost four years old, and her mother had gone to work and couldn&#x2019;t keep her, so she&#x2019;d gone to live with Daddy and Grandma Welker. But then Daddy had gone away to work somewhere else, and she had lived with just Grandma; and Grandma, too, thought she was peculiar. While she lived with Grandma, Monica had come to see her sometimes, but it was clear Katie made her nervous.<br> <br>Of course, part of that, Katie realized, was her own fault. When she knew that some of the things she did were things no other kid she&#x2019;d ever met could do, maybe she should have stopped doing them. At least where other people could know about them, anyway. But it was like having an itch and not scratching it. When she wanted to move something, the compulsion was too strong to resist; usually, she&#x2019;d already done it by the time she thought about the consequences.<br> <br>Like the time her grandma had hurt her leg and was muttering about not wanting to leave her Social Security check in the mailbox for fear those nasty Johnson boys would steal it on their way home from school. They often went along peeking into everyone&#x2019;s boxes to see what was there, and more than once they&#x2019;d scattered mail in the ditches beside the road.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can walk that far,&#x201d; Grandma Welker had said, rubbing at the knee she&#x2019;d twisted when she slipped on the cellar steps.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could go get the check,&#x201d; Katie offered.<br> <br>&#x201c;No, no. I don&#x2019;t want you to go out there alone in this bad weather. You know what happened the last time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The last time a man had stopped and asked her if she wanted a ride. He was a perfectly nice man, Katie knew he was, and she hadn&#x2019;t gotten into the car, and the man had simply smiled and driven away. Katie had tried to explain that it was only that he thought she was a long way from home, and it was cold and raining, and he was kind. But Grandma Welker was convinced he was a child molester.<br> <br>Katie was a little vague about what child molesters actually did. But she knew it was something unpleasant, and she had sense enough not to get into a car or walk away with a stranger, for heaven&#x2019;s sake. Grownups told you and told you things, and then they acted as if you didn&#x2019;t have any brains at all, even when they admitted you were bright.<br> <br>So, not wanting to upset her grandma, Katie had said no more. But when the old woman was busy peeling potatoes for supper, Katie sat in the window seat in the dining room and concentrated on the mailbox. The door of it stuck, and for a few minutes she thought it wasn&#x2019;t going to come open. But then it did, and she lifted the tan envelope that the government check always came in, wafted it noiselessly through the air, opened the door, brought it in, and deposited it on the dining room table.<br> <br>Grandma Welker found it when she came in to set the table. She let out a sort of yelp, like old Dusty when someone rocked on his tail, and almost dropped the plates she was carrying.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where did that come from?&#x201d; she demanded.<br> <br>Katie turned from the window seat, pulling her short skirt down over her knees to cover the scabs. &#x201c;What?&#x201d; she asked innocently.<br> <br>&#x201c;My check! My Social Security check!&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie simply stared at her blankly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the mailman bring it up to the house?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He must have,&#x201d; Katie decided, seeing an easy way out. Only her grandma couldn&#x2019;t leave it at that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he give it to you? Did he knock on the door?&#x201d;<br> <br>Katie stared. She knew it bothered the adults around her, the way she could keep her small face perfectly expressionless, yet it seemed the safest thing to do most of the time.<br> <br>After a moment, her grandma gave up and took the check away, muttering under her breath.<br> <br>Maybe, Katie thought, it would have been better to risk having the Johnson boys steal it than to have saved her grandma the walk to the mailbox.<br> <br>It had taken her a while to learn to be careful about what she moved. She knew the name for the moving, now; she&#x2019;d read it in a book. Telekinesis. That meant that she was able to move objects from one place to another without touching them. At first she hadn&#x2019;t realized that she was the only one who could do it. But when people got upset or excited about it, it didn&#x2019;t take her long to catch on.<br> <br>There had been a time when Grandma Welker had been busy in the kitchen and had spoken to Katie over her shoulder. &#x201c;I need a clean hanky. Be a good girl; run upstairs and get me one out of my top bureau drawer.&#x201d;<br> <br>And Katie, who was curled in the rocking chair munching on an apple and reading Call of the Wild, paused long enough to slide open the bureau drawer, mentally search out the handkerchief, and waft the square of linen down the stairs and into Grandma&#x2019;s apron pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Katie! Did you hear what I said? Run upstairs&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a hanky in your pocket,&#x201d; Katie said, spitting out a seed and looking up long enough to see the amazement creep over her grandma&#x2019;s face when she felt in the apron pocket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why, I declare, there wasn&#x2019;t one there a minute ago&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked suspiciously at Katie, who was again engrossed in her book.<br> <br>&#x201c;I could see the edge of it sticking out,&#x201d; Katie said. Grandma Welker said no more, but the suspicion remained, unspoken.<br> <br>As time went on, this peculiar ability of Katie&#x2019;s made more and more problems between them. When Katie learned how to turn off the light from the wall switch after she&#x2019;d gotten into bed and turn the pages of her book without touching them (she didn&#x2019;t mean to do that when someone was watching her, but sometimes she forgot) and smooth her hair without using the hair brush, she made Grandma Welker nervous.<br> <br>Grandma stopped taking her to church after the time the pages of Pastor Grooten&#x2019;s sermon got all mixed up, although Katie hadn&#x2019;t actually had anything to do with that. A breeze had come in the open window (it was a very hot day), and the pages had slithered off onto the floor, and when he picked them up they were out of order.<br> <br>Of course, she had been responsible when Pastor Grooten&#x2019;s hair stood on end and seemed to do an odd little dance. It had been a long, boring sermon, and Katie, unable to keep her mind on it, had started entertaining herself. She hadn&#x2019;t thought anyone would notice. She&#x2019;d also stirred up air currents carrying pollen from a nearby field of ragweed, and people in the congregation had begun to grab for their handkerchiefs.<br> <br>Pastor Grooten was the sort of preacher who didn&#x2019;t appreciate crying babies during his sermons, nor coughing and sneezing. He had paused and looked down on his flock, frowning. How could all those people suddenly have to sneeze at the same time?<br> <br>Just for the fun of it, Katie had shifted the air current then so that the pollen drifted under his own nose; and when he sneezed, Pastor Grooten had to grab for his sermon pages before they sailed off the lecturn. But they didn&#x2019;t actually slide until the next Sunday. On that day Katie remembered how suspicious her grandma had been about Pastor&#x2019;s hair standing on end the Sunday before (after the windows had been closed by one of the deacons). It all came to a head after the service when Grandma had said Katie could stay with old Mrs. Tanner, down the road, instead of going to church. Mrs. Tanner was bedridden, and Katie could read to her for an hour and a half a week, on Sunday mornings.<br> <br>Katie didn&#x2019;t mind. She read very well&#x2014;she had taught herself to read at the age of three&#x2014;and Mrs. Tanner let her read anything she wanted to. Katie read her Gentle Ben, and The View From the Cherry Tree, ...</p><h2>An End to Suffering: The Buddha in the World</h2><p><p><i>An End to Suffering</i> tells of Pankaj Mishra's search to understand the Buddha's relevance in today's world, where religious violence, poverty and terrorism prevail. As he travels among Islamists and the emerging Hindu Muslim class in India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, Mishra explores the myths and places of the Buddha's life, the West's "discovery" of Buddhism, and the impact of Buddhist ideas on such modern politicians as Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Mishra ultimately reaches an enlightenment of his own by discovering the living meaning of the Buddha's teaching, in this "unusually discerning, beautifully written, and deeply affecting reflection on Buddhism" (<i>Booklist</i>).</p></p><p><p><b>Pankaj Mishra</b> was born in North India in 1969 and now lives in London and India. He is the author of <i>The Romantics,</i> winner of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>'s Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction, and a frequent contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books, Granta,</i> and the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.</p><p>The Invention of &#x2018;Buddhism&#x2019;</p><p>THE DAYS WERE SHORTENING with intimations of winter when I returned from the inner Himalayas to Mashobra. When spring came, and the roads cleared, I began to travel to the Spiti and Pin valleys. There, in the lonely cold deserts, speckled wherever the snow melted into streams with green oases of pea and barley fields, and watched over by hilltop monasteries of sun-baked bricks, I saw many more images of the Buddha. I visited Tabo, and found the oldest monastery in the region still full of lamas, as jaunty in their maroon robes as the prayer flags fluttering from electric poles in the treeless expanses.</p><p>I came to recognize the colourful murals and to understand somewhat the symbolism of the mystical circular diagrams (mandalas) on the wall hangings. I could spot from afar the distinctive shape of the gompas, or Buddhist monasteries; and although I felt excluded by the faith they expressed, about which I knew little then, I came to value them for their solitude and distance from the known world.</p><p>I was intrigued, too, by the monks, their childlike simplicity, cheerfulness and serenity. I attributed these qualities to the plain and undemanding world the monks lived in, until I found out that some of them had travelled to, and spent time in, Europe and America. One of them had studied in a monastery near Lhasa for about twenty years; I was surprised to know that his subjects had been logic, epistemology, cosmology, psychology and ethics as expounded in Buddhist texts written in India as early as the second century AD.</p><p>I began to write a travel essay, in which I tried to record my surprise at finding traces of Buddhism in these remote Himalayan valleys. I wrote about the other kind of Indian Buddhists I had met before: they were Dalits, low-caste Hindus, millions of whom had converted to Buddhism since the 1950s in an attempt to escape an oppressively caste-ridden Hinduism. I tried to describe how these politically active Buddhists, who did not appear to take much interest in spiritual matters, differed from the monks in the Himalayan monasteries.</p><p>The small bookshop on the Mall in Simla was well stocked with books in English on Buddhism &#x2013; in expectation, the owner told me, of the European and American tourists who came looking for writing on spiritual figures and themes, and often travelled from Simla to the hill town of Dharamshala, the home of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan community in exile.</p><p>One of the books I found there was an English translation of the Milindapanha (Questions of King Menander), which I had seen mentioned as a basic text of Buddhist philosophy in an essay by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. King Menander was a Greek who reigned in north-west India, now Pakistan, in the first or second century BC. He is said to be among the rulers of the time who embraced, or was at least familiar with, Buddhism. The book, which was preserved in Ceylon for centuries, consists of Menander&#x2019;s conversations with an elderly Buddhist monk called Nagasena.</p><p>Their dialogue on the individual self, which drew explicitly upon the Buddha&#x2019;s ideas, had particularly struck Borges. It begins with Menander asking Nagasena his name. Nagasena says that his name is &#x2018;only a generally understood term, a practical designation. There is no question of a permanent individual implied in the use of the word.&#x2019;</p><p>Menander replies, &#x2018;If there is no permanent individuality, who gives you monks your robes and food, lodging and medicines? And who makes use of them? Who lives a life of righteousness, meditation and reaches Nirvana? Who destroys living beings, steals, fornicates, tells lies, or drinks spirits? . . . If your fellow monks call you Nagasena, what then is Nagasena? Would you say that your hair is Nagasena? Or your nails, teeth, skin, or other parts of your body, or the outward form, or sensation, or perception, or the psychic constructions, or consciousness? Are any of these Nagasena? Are all these taken together Nagasena? Or, anything other than they?&#x2019;</p><p>Nagasena answers no to all of Menander&#x2019;s questions.</p><p>Menander says, &#x2018;Then for all my asking I find no Nagasena. Nagasena is a mere sound! Surely what your reverence has said is false!&#x2019;</p><p>Nagasena now takes over the questioning. He asks Menander, &#x2018;Your Majesty, how did you come here &#x2013; on foot, or in a vehicle?&#x2019;</p><p>Menander replies, &#x2018;In a chariot.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Then tell me,&#x2019; Nagasena asks, &#x2018;what is the chariot? Is the pole the chariot?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, your reverence,&#x2019; Menander replies.</p><p>&#x2018;Or the axles, wheels, frame, reins, yoke, spokes, or goad?&#x2019;</p><p>Menander replies that none of these things is the chariot.</p><p>&#x2018;Then all these separate parts taken together are the chariot?&#x2019;</p><p>Menander again says no.</p><p>&#x2018;Then is the chariot something other than the separate parts?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No, your reverence,&#x2019; Menander says.</p><p>&#x2018;Then for all my asking, your Majesty,&#x2019; Nagasena says, &#x2018;I can find no chariot. The chariot is a mere sound. What then is the chariot? Surely what your Majesty has said is false! There is no chariot!&#x2019;</p><p>Menander protests that what he had said was not false. &#x2018;It is on account of all these various components, the pole, axle, wheels and so on, that the vehicle is called a chariot. It&#x2019;s just a generally understood term, a practical designation.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Well said, your Majesty!&#x2019; Nagasena replies. &#x2018;You know what the word chariot means! And it&#x2019;s just the same with me. It&#x2019;s on account of the various components of my being that I am known by the generally understood term, the practical designation, Nagasena.&#x2019;1</p><p>There were many such clear and simple exchanges in the book, illustrating the Buddhist view of individual identity as a construct, a composite of matter, form, perceptions, ideas, instincts and consciousness, but without an unchanging unity or integrity.</p><p>&#x2018;I think, therefore I am,&#x2019; Descartes had said; and when I first came across these famous words as an undergraduate they expressed all that then seemed holy to me: individuality, the life of the mind. It was comforting to believe that the human mind was capable of acting rationally, logically and freely upon the inert outside world. I was attracted, too, by the idea of the authentic self, which I had picked up from the French existentialist philosophers, who for some reason were very popular in India. These descriptions of the self &#x2013; as a discrete entity shaped through rational thought and act &#x2013; helped offset the uncertainties (financial, emotional, sexual) that I lived with then.</p><p>But the dialogue between the Greek king and the Buddhist monk seemed to refute intellectually the Cartesian &#x2018;I&#x2019;, by implying that one cannot speak of a separate self or mind thinking &#x2018;I think&#x2019; inside the body, inasmuch as this self is nothing but a series of thoughts. It suggested that the &#x2018;I&#x2019; was not a stable and autonomous entity and indeed was no more than a convenient label for the provisional relations among its constantly changing physical and mental parts. It also matched better my experience: of finding incoherence where there was supposed to be a self, of being led on by stray thoughts, memories and moods, and thinking that nothing existed beyond that flux.</p><p>I read other books. I learned quickly that although Buddhism often had the trappings of a formal religion &#x2013; rituals and superstitions &#x2013; in the countries where it existed, it was unlike other religions in that it was primarily a rigorous therapy and cure for duhkha, the Sanskrit term denoting pain, frustration and sorrow. The Buddha, which means &#x2018;the enlightened one&#x2019;, was not God, or His emissary on earth, but the individual who had managed to liberate himself from ordinary human suffering, and then, out of compassion, had shared his insights with others. He had placed no value on prayer or belief in a deity; he had not spoken of creation, original sin or the last judgement.</p><p>He had spoken instead of a suffering that was man-made and thus eradicable. He had confined himself to human beings living everyday lives with desire, attachment, pride, jealousy and hatred. He had analysed the workings of these emotions and asserted that they arise from a craving for and an attachment to a self that has no true existence. He had developed analytic and contemplative techniques which helped prove that neither the self nor the phenomenal world are solid, stable and discrete entities, and which attuned the human mind to &#x2018;things as they really are&#x2019;: interconnected and in a state of change.</p><p>The Buddha was, broadly speaking, an empiricist who denied that there are any fixed substances underlying appearances; this is true as much for what one feels to be one&#x2019;s inner self or ego as for the outer world. He claimed that experience, rather than speculative metaphysics, holds the key to wisdom. He assumed that the quality of all human experience depends on the mind and so had been concerned with analysing and transforming the individual mind. To see that one was neither identical with one&#x2019;s thoughts as they arose continuously and discursively in one&#x2019;s mind, generating desire, anxiety, fear and guilt, nor indeed limited by them, was to be aware of the possibility of controlling them and of moving towards a new kind of spiritual and intellectual freedom.</p><p>Clearly, the Buddha had been more of a trenchant thinker and psychologist than a religious figure. He, and later interpreters of his ideas, had investigated in detail the contents of human consciousness; they had located in it a quality of will which when strengthened through meditation can become an effective barrier against craving and suffering.</p><p>But, reading the often very abstract and difficult Buddhist treatises on the mind, I often wondered why the Buddha, ostensibly the founder of a religion, had concerned himself with this kind of close and dry analysis of the inner world of experience; why had he not extended his analysis to the external world, tried to establish clear, distinct and certain foundations for knowledge, and founded, like Descartes, a tradition of scientific enquiry? Certainly Buddhism with its rational outlook was immune to the kind of conflict between religion and science that defined modern western philosophy.</p><p>It seemed that the Buddha had had other priorities and that he had been concerned almost exclusively with the inescapable fact of suffering. But here, too, he seemed to differ radically from the intellectual fathers of the modern world, Rousseau, Hobbes and Marx. For he had presumed to offer a cure for human suffering that did not involve large-scale restructuring of state and society.</p><p>Mr Sharma, whom I told about my growing interest in the Buddha, couldn&#x2019;t say much about this. He had taken to dropping in more often than before, and he appeared to have loosened up a bit. He told me more about his life. He had grown up in a village near Simla, among apple and pear orchards. He had spent no time at all on the plains; he spoke with something like pride of how his few visits there had proved to be ordeals. When he spoke of the Himalayas as a place of exile and refuge, when he told me about the nearby regions which the Pandava brothers in the Mahabharata had visited thousands of years ago, he seemed to be speaking not so much of the myths of the race &#x2013; the idea of the Indian plains with their relentless heat and dust as a trap &#x2013; as of his own life.</p><p>He had never married; family life with its obligations was, he said, not for him. But he seemed not altogether at ease in his self-imposed solitude. I wondered if he sometimes resented it, and wished, like everyone else, that he could have had another, more active and fruitful life, far away from the small place where he had spent, and was now to end, his life.</p><p>He seemed a bit puzzled by my interest in the Buddha. He said that Dalits, low-caste Hindus, who had converted to Buddhism thinking it to be something opposed to Hinduism, had dragged the Buddha&#x2019;s name through mud. For the Buddha was actually the tenth incarnation of the Hindu God Vishnu, and had emerged from the mouth of Brahma, and therefore was part of rather than opposed to the Hindu tradition.</p><p>I told him that this was more myth than history. The Buddha may have emerged metaphorically from the mouth of Brahma, but the evidence collected by British scholars in the nineteenth century had proved that he had also been a flesh-and-blood being, a figure no less historical than Jesus and the Prophet Mohammed, and, furthermore, that he had lived and died not far from where we were. I also told Mr Sharma that I had been to the Buddha&#x2019;s birthplace in Nepal and seen the iron pillar erected there by Ashoka, the third-century BC Indian emperor.</p><p>*</p><p>The Buddha&#x2019;s birthplace is called Lumbini, and is just north of the vast Indian plain across which the great rivers of the subcontinent, the Ganges and the Yamuna, flow. The legends of the Buddha speak of it being close to the Himalayan foothills. This gives the place romance: tall mountains and waterfalls and pine forests as the backdrop to the Buddha&#x2019;s luxurious childhood.</p><p>But when you finally get there &#x2013; after a long, arduous journey within either India or Nepal &#x2013; the high mountains to the north are no more than a rumour; at best, an added chill in the winter breezes, and a faint swelling on the horizon on clear spring days. The feeling of being exposed in the vast flat land never leaves you, especially in the summer when, after weeks of blistering heat, whirlwinds of fine dust and dry leaves scatter across the exhausted rice fields and the huddled villages of mud and straw.</p><p>Occasionally, there are clusters of mango and tamarind trees and ponds: oases of shade and cool, where the physical world regains form and colour. The land that looks so parched grows quickly green after the first rains of the monsoons in late June or early July. Two months of monsoons impose an unruly lushness upon it. But the endless rain wearies; the prickly heat saps energy; and the rivers and streams often burst their banks, turning the earth into obdurate mud. It is only during the months from October to March that the weather stops being punitive. All day long a mellow light falls gently over the busy fields and the villages from a tenderly blue sky. The evenings are short, and the nights often chilly.</p><p>In 1985, when I visited Lumbini, I was sixteen years old. I had just left home for the first time and was living as a student in Allahabad, one of the emerging urban centres of the Buddha&#x2019;s time and now a decaying old provincial city in the Gangetic plain. I travelled cheaply and very slowly, on trains pulled by steam engines and country buses and, once, on a ferry over a dangerously swollen muddy river, passing through the places that the Buddha as a young scion called Siddhartha had dreamed of visiting.</p><p>I am not sure if you can travel much faster these days. Things don&#x2019;t change much in that impoverished part of North India; when I revisited Lumbini many years later I found myself wandering through the same empty land, past the same yellow fields of mustard and forgotten villages and small towns.</p><p>Lumbini itself has a few more buildings, mainly monasteries run by Buddhists from Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Myanmar. New monasteries are being built in the distinctive national styles of South-east Asia. Some miles away, there is an expensive hotel catering mostly to Japanese tourists, and a research institute with a grand but deserted library.</p><p>Very few Buddhists live in Lumbini or its environs and these are mostly monks from South-east Asia. There is a temple with a stone relief of Maya, the Buddha&#x2019;s mother, who was worshipped by local Hindus for centuries as a Hindu deity. The nearby towns &#x2013; poor and squalid &#x2013; are full of shrines to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey-god.

For the first time, he basks in endless amounts of sweetmeats, champagne, and the finest cheeses a mouse could ever want. But when life at His Majesty&#x2019;s Court starts to show its darker sides, the country mouse quickly learns that the town&#x2019;s riches aren&#x2019;t worth losing the peace and tranquility of his own quiet home. In this classic tale of two of friends, Paul Galdone&#x2019;s gorgeous illustrations and simple prose remind us where we find life&#x2019;s true treasures. </p></p><p><p>Paul Galdone was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1907 and emigrated to the United States in 1928. After finishing his studies at the Art Student League and the New York School of Industrial Design, Mr. Galdone worked in the art department of a major publishing house. There he was introduced to the process of bookmaking, an activity that was soon to become his lifelong career. Before his death in 1986, Mr. Galdone illustrated almost three hundred books, many of which he himself wrote or retold. He is fondly remembered for his contemporary style, bright earthy humor, and action-filled illustrations, which will continue to delight for generations to come.</p></p><h2>Indigenous Healing: Exploring Traditional Paths</h2><p>Imagine a world in which people see themselves as embedded in the natural order, with ethical responsibilities not only toward each other, but also toward rocks, trees, water and all nature. Imagine seeing yourself not as a master of Creation, but as the most humble, dependent and vulnerable part. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Rupert Ross explores this indigenous world view and the determination of indigenous thinkers to restore it to full prominence today. He comes to understand that an appreciation of this perspective is vital to understanding the destructive forces of colonization. As a former Crown Attorney in northern Ontario, Ross witnessed many of these forces. He examines them here with a special focus on residential schools and their power to destabilize entire communities long after the last school has closed. With help from many indigenous authors, he explores their emerging conviction that healing is now better described as &#x201c;decolonization therapy.&#x201d; And the key to healing, they assert, is a return to the traditional indigenous world view.<br> &nbsp;<br> The author of two previous bestsellers on indigenous themes, <i>Dancing with a Ghost</i> and <i>Returning to the Teachings</i>, Ross shares his continuing personal journey into traditional understanding with all of the confusion, delight and exhilaration of learning to see the world in a different way.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Ross sees the beginning of a vibrant future for indigenous people across Canada as they begin to restore their own definition of a &#x201c;healthy person&#x201d; and bring that indigenous wellness into being once again. <i>Indigenous Healing</i> is a hopeful book, not only for indigenous people, but for all others open to accepting some of their ancient lessons about who we might choose to be.</p><p>RUPERT ROSS is a retired assistant Crown Attorney for the District of Kenora, Ontario. Starting in 1985, he conducted criminal prosecutions for more than twenty remote Ojibway and Cree First Nations communities in northwestern Ontario. His first book, <i>Dancing with a Ghost</i>, started his exploration of aboriginal visions of existence and became a bestseller. His second book, <i>Returning to the Teachings</i>, was also a bestseller and examined the aboriginal preference for the &#x201c;peacemaker justice&#x201d; he observed during a three-year secondment with Justice Canada. Both books were shortlisted for the Gordon Montour Award for the best Canadian non-fiction book on social issues, and are presently used in universities and colleges across North America. Following his retirement, Ross was awarded the prestigious 2011 National Prosecution Award for Humanitarianism, and the Ontario Crown Attorneys Association has created an award named after him. He continues to live just north of Kenora with his wife, Val.</p><h2>Birds of the Pacific Northwest Coast</h2><p>More than 200 species of common birds are grouped and color-coded for quick identification.

The authors are particularly concerned with change and continuity since the economic crisis of the early 1980s and the structural adjustment that followed. <br><br>Providing a comprehensive introduction to a country they know well, the Biesanzes also contribute astutely to an understanding of the reciprocal influence of structural adjustment and national culture.</p><p>The late Mavis Hiltunen Biesanz was author (with John Biesanz) of Costa Rican Life and The People of Panama and (with Richard and Karen Biesanz) The Costa Ricans.

Richard Biesanz is professor of sociology and anthropology at Corning Community College. Karen Zubris Biesanz writes on Costa Rican society.When I was researching Costa Rica as a candidate place for retirement, despite some effort, I was unable to find much literature beyond the standard travel and retirement guides and a few rather dry tomes of some international institutions. I was therefore delighted to come across and read The Ticos. <p>The writing is a nice blend of hard facts and well-researched statistics with deductions from personal interviews, all of which is neatly intertwined with astute personal observation and personal anecdotes. It is very well-written. The language flows as easily as in a good novel. </p><p>All in all, a most interesting book. I strongly recommend it to foreign residents of Costa Rica.

Now, in this Very Short Introduction, Lee provides a magnificent look at the genre in which she is an undisputed master--the art of biography. Here Lee considers the cultural and historical background of different types of biographies, looks at the factors that affect biographers, and asks whether there are different strategies, ethics, and principles required for writing about one person compared to another. She also discusses contemporary biographical publications and considers what kind of "lives" are the most popular and in demand. And along the way, she answers such questions as why do certain people and historical events arouse so much interest? How can biographies be compared with history and works of fiction? Does a biography need to be true? Is it acceptable to omit or conceal things? Does the biographer need to personally know the subject?

Once a joyful time when children grow into school gradually, today it often resembles a watered-down first grade, where academic pressures squelch creativity and play. <i>The Literate Kindergarten </i>shows how carefully balancing academics with song, movement, talk, and play creates an environment where every child can grow and learn.

Den Hartog, retired professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, reflects the author's unique ability to combine the scholarly insight of a distinguished scientist with the practical, problem-solving orientation of an experienced industrial engineer. Although mathematics plays a role in the subject, Den Hartog employs the simplest possible mathematical approaches. His lucid explanations of complex problems are presented in a direct style and supported by illustrative models. Numerous figures in the text enhance its value as a basic foundation in a field which Den Hartog calls "a necessary tool for almost every mechanical engineer." The author examines such topics as the kinematics of vibration (including harmonic motions and non-harmonic periodic motions), degrees of freedom, gyroscopic effects, relaxation oscillations, Rayleigh's method, natural frequencies of torsional vibration, Karman vortices, and systems with variable elasticity. Drawing on his experience as an engineer in private industry and in the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships, Den Hartog applies theory to practice, discussing the effects of vibrations on turbines, electrical machines, helicopter rotors and airplane wings, diesel engines and electrical transmission lines.<br>As a special aid to classroom work or self-study, this practical text includes an extensive selection of 233 problems and answers that test the student's mastery of every section of the book. In addition, a highly useful Appendix contains "A Collection of Formulas" for determining the load per inch deflection of linear springs, the load per radian rotation of rotational springs, the natural frequencies of simple systems, the longitudinal and torsional vibration of uniform beams, the transverse or bending vibrations of uniform beams, and the vibrations of rings, membranes, and plates.<br>When <i>Mechanical Vibrations </i>was first published in 1934, it was a pioneering work in a field which had just been introduced in America's technical schools. In fact, the author wrote it to assist him in teaching the subject at Harvard. "During the life of the book," he says, "from 1934 on, the art and science of engineering has grown at an astonishing rate and the subject of vibration has expanded with it." Professor Den Hartog's constant revisions have kept his book at the forefront of this vital subject, as useful today as its earlier versions were to students of the past.</p><p></p></p><p><p><b>J. P. Den Hartog: The Reprint Engineer</b> <br>J. P. Den Hartog (1901&#x2013;1989), who taught for most of his career at MIT, was one of the founders of the Dover reprint program in engineering. As the author of several books that Dover reprinted and still has in print, and as an advisor from the 1950s until just a few years before his death in 1989, Professor Den Hartog gave invaluable advice concerning books of lasting interest and importance in his field. </p><p> </p><p>Not many books in engineering have a productive shelf life spanning several decades. Among the exceptions are these four books of Professor Den Hartog, which Dover reprinted and occasionally revised in later printings from 1961 through 1987: <i>Mechanics,</i> 1961, <i>Strength of Materials,</i> 1961, <i>Mechanical Vibrations,</i> 1985, and <i>Advanced Strength of Materials, </i>1987. Still widely read and cited by authors in these areas, Den Hartog's books are a tribute to his gift for exposition and clarity. </p><p> </p><p>The J. P. Den Hartog Award, established in 1987, is presented in recognition of lifetime contributions to the teaching and practice of vibration engineering.</p></p><h2>The Triumph of the Dark: European International History 1933-1939 (Oxford History of Modern Europe)</h2><p>In this magisterial narrative, Zara Steiner traces the twisted road to war that began with Hitler's assumption of power in Germany. Covering a wide geographical canvas, from America to the Far East, Steiner provides an indispensable reassessment of the most disputed events of these tumultuous years. <br><br>Steiner underlines the far-reaching consequences of the Great Depression, which shifted the initiative in international affairs from those who upheld the status quo to those who were intent on destroying it. In Europe, the l930s were Hitler's years. He moved the major chess pieces on the board, forcing the others to respond. From the start, Steiner argues, he intended war, and he repeatedly gambled on Germany's future to acquire the necessary resources to fulfil his continental ambitions. Only war could have stopped him-an unwelcome message for most of Europe. Misperception, miscomprehension, and misjudgment on the part of the other Great Powers leaders opened the way for Hitler's repeated diplomatic successes. <br><br>It is ideology that distinguished the Hitler era from previous struggles for the mastery of Europe. Ideological presumptions created false images and raised barriers to understanding that even good intelligence could not penetrate. Only when the leaders of Britain and France realized the scale of Hitler's ambition, and the challenge Germany posed to their Great Power status, did they finally declare war.<br></p><p><br><strong>Zara Steiner</strong> is Emeritus Fellow, New Hall, University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of the British Academy.<br><br>"<em>The Triumph of the Dark</em> is magisterial in design, meticulous in execution, and curiously oldfashioned in its inclinations.

In<em> Central Asia in World History</em>, Peter B. Golden provides an engaging account of this important region, ranging from prehistory to the present, focusing largely on the unique melting pot of cultures that this region has produced over millennia. Golden describes the traders who braved the heat and cold along caravan routes to link East Asia and Europe; the Mongol Empire of Chinggis Khan and his successors, the largest contiguous land empire in history; the invention of gunpowder, which allowed the great sedentary empires to overcome the horse-based nomads; the power struggles of Russia and China, and later Russia and Britain, for control of the area. Finally, he discusses the region today, a key area that neighbors such geopolitical hot spots as Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China.<br></p><p><br><strong>Peter B. Golden </strong>is Professor Emeritus of History and Director of the Middle Eastern Studies Program, Rutgers University.<br><br>"Peter Golden's scholarship has long defined the gold standard in the study of the Turks of Central Asia and has given him a commanding position in Central Asian studies generally. Students of Central Asian history and their teachers owe a great debt of gratitude to Peter Golden for writing this book."--<em>Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Arithmetic</h2><p><p>Because evolution endowed humans with a complement of ten fingers, a grouping size of ten seems natural to us, perhaps even ideal. But from the perspective of mathematics, groupings of ten are arbitrary, and can have serious shortcomings. Twelve would be better for divisibility, and eight is smaller and well suited to repeated halving. Grouping by two, as in binary code, has turned out to have its own remarkable advantages.</p><p>Paul Lockhart reveals arithmetic not as the rote manipulation of numbers&#x2015;a practical if mundane branch of knowledge best suited for balancing a checkbook or filling out tax forms&#x2015;but as a set of ideas that exhibit the fascinating and sometimes surprising behaviors usually reserved for higher branches of mathematics. The essence of arithmetic is the skillful arrangement of numerical information for ease of communication and comparison, an elegant intellectual craft that arises from our desire to count, add to, take away from, divide up, and multiply quantities of important things. Over centuries, humans devised a variety of strategies for representing and using numerical information, from beads and tally marks to adding machines and computers. Lockhart explores the philosophical and aesthetic nature of counting and of different number systems, both Western and non-Western, weighing the pluses and minuses of each.</p><p>A passionate, entertaining survey of foundational ideas and methods, <i>Arithmetic </i>invites readers to experience the profound and simple beauty of its subject through the eyes of a modern research mathematician.</p></p><p>Paul Lockhart teaches mathematics at Saint Ann&#x2019;s School in Brooklyn, New York.&#x201c;Today&#x2019;s world is more dependent on numbers than at any time in human history, yet with the ready availability of cheap, reliable devices that handle computation, we have never had less need to master arithmetic. Our newfound freedom from the chore of hand computation makes it both possible and, Paul Lockhart argues in this wonderful new book, desirable to step back and reflect on the entire development of arithmetic over several millennia. What are numbers, how did they arise, why did our ancestors invent them, and how did they represent them? They are, after all, one of humankind&#x2019;s most brilliant inventions, arguably having greater impact on our lives than the wheel.

In this convincing new account Robert Allen argues that the British industrial revolution was a successful response to the global economy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He shows that in Britain wages were high and capital and energy cheap in comparison to other countries in Europe and Asia. As a result, the breakthrough technologies of the industrial revolution - the steam engine, the cotton mill, and the substitution of coal for wood in metal production - were uniquely profitable to invent and use in Britain. The high wage economy of pre-industrial Britain also fostered industrial development since more people could afford schooling and apprenticeships. It was only when British engineers made these new technologies more cost-effective during the nineteenth century that the industrial revolution would spread around the world.</p><p>This landmark global economic history explains why the Industrial Revolution occurred in Britain by highlighting the ways in which Britain was different from other countries in Europe and Asia. Combining economic, social, technological and business history, Allen shows the importance of globalisation in explaining the divergence of East and West.Robert C. Allen is Professor of Economic History at Oxford University and a fellow of Nuffield College.

Patel shows us that Americans from George Washington to Martin Luther King Jr. have been &#x201c;interfaith leaders,&#x201d; illustrating how the forces of pluralism in America have time and again defeated the forces of prejudice. And now a new generation needs to rise up and confront the anti-Muslim prejudice of our era. To this end, Patel offers a primer in the art and science of interfaith work, bringing to life the growing body of research on how faith can be a bridge of cooperation rather than a barrier of division and sharing stories from the frontlines of interfaith activism. <br>&nbsp;<br>Patel asks us to share in his vision of a better America&#x2014;a robustly pluralistic country in which our commonalities are more important than our differences, and in which difference enriches, rather than threatens, our religious traditions. Pluralism, Patel boldly argues, is at the heart of the American project, and this visionary book will inspire Americans of all faiths to make this country a place where diverse traditions can thrive side by side.</p></p><p><b>Eboo Patel</b> is the founder and president of Interfaith Youth Core and the author of <i>Acts of Faith</i>. He was a member of President Obama&#x2019;s inaugural faith council, is a regular contributor to the <i>Washington Post</i>,<i> Huffington Post</i>, CNN, and public radio, and speaks frequently about interfaith cooperation on college campuses. He lives in Chicago with his wife and two boys.<b>From chapter 1, "Ground Zero"</b><br><br> A few months after 9/11, my father went to a banquet hosted by a Muslim activist organization. Somber prayers were offered for the victims of the attacks, and appropriate anger was directed at the terrorists. One of the hosts gave a passionate address about the coming threat to Muslims in America: how our rights were about to be trampled by the government in the name of security. The response, he told the fired-up crowd, should be a Muslim civil rights movement.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The chief guest at the dinner was the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Perhaps the Muslim speaker felt as if he was paying homage to the movement Jackson had helped lead. If so, what happened next must have come as something of a shock. Jackson opened his speech by saying there is no such thing as Muslim civil rights.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a well-honed sense of victimhood in some segments of the American Muslim community. You can see it in the e-mail newsletters of certain Muslim organizations. Every other story is an incident of a Muslim being wronged. Some Muslims have become expert in stringing such stories together, collecting them into a grand narrative of Muslim suffering stretching from Gaza to Green Bay. During the Ground Zero Mosque episode, I half-expected to see such newsletters linking the prejudice faced by American Muslims to the oppression of Palestinians, Iraqis, Afghans, and Chechens. Instead, something very different happened. American Muslims contextualized the Cordoba House events not in the narrative of global Muslim suffering, but in the arc of American minority groups that have experienced discrimination. The talk was not about Palestinians and Iraqis over there, it was about blacks and Jews right here. Muslims began studying the American experience from the perspective of minorities that had been marginalized. They expected to find parallels to their own suffering. What they did not expect was a lesson in what it means to be American.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; America has not been a promise to all its people. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t land on Plymouth Rock,&#x201d; Malcolm X said. &#x201c;Plymouth Rock landed on us.&#x201d; Whatever the faiths of the workmen who came to Mount Vernon, they laid their bricks next to Washington&#x2019;s slaves. We are a nation whose creed speaks of welcoming all communities and whose practice has too often crushed them. But, to borrow from Maya Angelou, the dust was determined to rise, and generous enough to carry the rest of us with. People who knew the whip of the slave master in Alabama, the business end of the police baton on the South Side of Chicago, people who could easily have called our nation a lie, chose instead to believe America was a broken promise, and gave their bodies and their blood to fix it. As Langston Hughes wrote, even though &#x201c;America never was America to me,&#x201d; he was still committed to making the promise of this nation real, declaring one line later in his poem, &#x201c;America will be.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> That night at the Muslim activist banquet, Jesse Jackson wanted to make sure his audience left with a full understanding of the meaning of the civil rights movement. The marches, the sit-ins, the braving of fire hoses and attack dogs, had not been about safeguarding the rights of one community. The purpose was to expand and secure a framework that protected all communities. &#x201c;We weren&#x2019;t fighting for black civil rights,&#x201d; Jackson told his audience. &#x201c;We were fighting for your civil rights. You have a choice right now: you can talk about an America where your people don&#x2019;t get sent to the back of the bus, or you can talk about an America where no one gets sent to the back of the bus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could sense the emotion in my dad&#x2019;s voice when he called to tell me about the event. He paused for a long time, collecting his thoughts, and then said, &#x201c;We owe our presence in this country to that movement.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a movement not for the African American Dream but, in the words of Jesse Jackson&#x2019;s mentor, Martin Luther King Jr., for &#x201c;the American Dream, the dream of men of all races, creeds, national backgrounds, living together as brothers.&#x201d; It was not only a movement that helped pass legislation dismantling racist policies in the domestic realm but also a movement whose spirit changed immigration laws as well, ushering in the Immigration Act of 1965, legislation that allowed people like those gathered at that Muslim banquet to come to America. King had a vision of a nation where all communities participated in the privilege and responsibility of pluralism, a vision that included religious identity as readily as race: &#x201c;One of the first things we notice about this dream is an amazing universalism. It does not say some men, it says all men. It does not say all white men, but it says all men which includes black men. It doesn&#x2019;t say all Protestants, but it says all men which includes Catholics. It doesn&#x2019;t say all Gentiles, it says all men which includes Jews.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registering your story in the narrative of American discrimination offers opportunities for commiseration, but more importantly, it gives your community a dramatically expanded set of responsibilities. You quickly learn that other American communities used their moments of suffering to work for a nation where no one suffers. You quickly realize that other people&#x2019;s struggles have secured your rights. It begins to dawn on you that you have a responsibility to use the moment when the spotlight shines on you to secure the rights of others. &#x201c;Whoever degrades another degrades me,&#x201d; wrote Walt Whitman.19 That is the heart of the American spirit.</p><h2>Hit List (Keller Series, 2)</h2><p><p>Keller is a regular guy. He goes to the movies, works on his stamp collection. Call him for jury duty and he serves without complaint. Then every so often he gets a phone call from White Plains that sends him flying off somewhere to kill a perfect stranger. Keller is a pro and very good at what he does. But the jobs have started to go wrong. The realization is slow coming yet, when it arrives, it is irrefutable: Someone out there is trying to hit the hit man. Keller, God help him, has found his way onto somebody else's hit list.</p></p><p>Few mystery authors have a stable of protagonists as uniformly appealing as Lawrence Block's. Whether Block's taking the reader into PI Matthew Scudder's world of dimly lit bars and basement AA meetings, quirky burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr's used bookstore, or the international hot-spot hangouts of Evan Tanner, the spy who never sleeps, he always provides good company. John Keller, star of Block's 1998 story collection <i>Hit Man</i>, is a typical Block invention: an unassuming, get-the-job-done-and-move-on New York contract killer who collects stamps, does the morning crossword, eats Vietnamese takeout, and falls for the occasional woman. <p> When Keller gets off a plane in Louisville, ready to do the job he's been hired for, something about it feels wrong from the start. And when two people are killed in the motel room he's just vacated, he realizes he narrowly missed a setup, but can't figure out why. Then he goes to Boston to do another job, and afterwards dines in a coffee shop where another patron has the misfortune of leaving with Keller's raincoat: </p><blockquote>The <i>Globe</i> didn't have it. But there it was in the <i>Herald</i>, a small story on a back page, a man found dead on Boston Common, shot twice in the head with a small-caliber weapon.<p> Keller could picture the poor bastard, lying face-down on the grass, the rain washing relentlessly down on him. He could picture the dead man's coat, too. The <i>Herald</i> didn't say anything about a coat, but that didn't matter. Keller could picture it all the same.</p></blockquote> Keller's agent, Dot, puts the pieces--including the death of another contract killer she books occasionally--together and comes up with the seemingly crazy idea that a greedy hit man is knocking off the competition. In between other legit hits, romancing a commitment-shy artist, visiting an astrologer, and a long stint on jury duty, Keller slowly moves closer to the faceless nemesis he and Dot dub "Roger." But it's Dot, the woman of action, who figures out what to do about him. Though <i>Hit List</i> is too introspective to be a caper novel, and too funny to be noir, it's bound to find a rapt audience with fans of both subgenres. After two such engaging books, can <i>Hit Parade</i> be far behind? <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre.

Following the Holocaust, the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 resulted in the establishment of the State of Israel, but it also shattered Palestinian Arab society and gave rise to a massive refugee problem. Morris offers distinctive accounts of each of the subsequent Israeli-Arab wars and details the sporadic peace efforts in between, culminating in the peace process initiated by the Rabin Government. In a new afterword to the Vintage edition, he examines Ehud Barak&#x2019;s leadership, the death of President Assad of Syria, and Israel&#x2019;s withdrawal from Lebanon, and the recent renewed conflict with the Palestinians. Studded with illuminating portraits of the major protagonists, <b>Righteous Victims</b><i> </i>provides an authoritative record of the middle east and its continuing struggle toward peace.</p><p>Making sense of any particular episode in the long and convoluted conflict between Arabs and Israelis can seem a Sisyphean task--engineering peace in the Middle East has become nearly clich�d in its complexity, with each individual dispute traceable back to years of anger, mistrust, and mutual misunderstanding fueled by cycles of violence and revenge. To add to this confusion, the historical record has been colored by "emphatic partisanship by commentators and historians from both sides, as well as by foreign observers," adds Middle East historian Benny Morris. So what Morris has undertaken in this volume--an inclusive, dispassionate, and rigorous history of the conflict, from Zionism's birth in the wake of the Russian pogroms through to the uncertain prospects for peace in 1999--is no mean feat.<p> A calm, balanced voice (although a controversial one among some who fear revisionism), Morris has previously proven his scholarship with such definitive titles as <i>Israel's Border Wars</i> and <i>The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem</i>. <i>Righteous Victims</i> likewise doesn't waver in its task, methodically unearthing the political and military roots of the struggle, from early friction between Zionist "colonizers" and native Arabs slowly through to the establishment of Israel and the bloody wars and terrorism that followed. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>en the Middle East has come closer to achieving peace than ever before, eminent Israeli historian Benny Morris explodes the myths cherished by both sides to present an epic history of Zionist-Arab relations over the past 120 years. <br><br>Tracing the roots of political Zionism back to the pogroms of Russia and the Dreyfus Affair, Morris describes the gradual influx of Jewish settlers into Palestine and the impact they had on the Arab population.

That Christmas carols were first composed in the fourth century? That certain Christmas customs, many still practiced in the early twentieth century, may have derived from that darkest of religious rites, human sacrifice? That beyond Christmas Day, even beyond the twelve days of Christmas, there is a whole season of traditional celebrations with many interconnections. <br>Based on extensive research, this book is a comprehensive account of Christmas customs and traditions in both their pagan and Christian aspects. Tracing the pagan survivals in holiday practices associated with not just Christmas but also the entire holiday season from All Saints Day to Epiphany, the author illuminates such practices and manifestations as ceremonial feasting and drinking, carol singing, bull-baiting, divination by young women to discover the identities of their future husbands, men masquerading as women and women masquerading as men, the Knecht Ruprecht and the Tomte Gubbe, the <i>Frauen,</i> the Yule log, the Christmas tree, Christmas decorations and gifts, special Christmas cakes, and much more. There is also substantial coverage of Christmas poetry and song, Christmas in liturgy and popular devotion, Christmas drama, and the pre-Christian winter festivals. <br>With its insightful writing and wide scholarship, this book is an important contribution to the understanding of the most popular holiday in the Western world. It will appeal to those of all faiths, and will be enjoyed for browsing as well as for serious study. <br></p><p></p><h2>List of the Lost</h2><p><p><b>'Beware the novelist . . . intimate and indiscreet . . . pompous, prophetic airs . . . here is the fact of fiction . . . an American tale where, naturally, evil conquers good, and none live happily ever after, for the complicated pangs of the empty experiences of flesh-and-blood human figures are the reason why nothing can ever be enough.

For more than 100 years, the American Kennel Club has been the nation's premier publisher of magazines on the subject of dogs. The American Kennel Club magazines, <i>AKC Gazette</i>, <i>AKC Family Dog</i>, and <i>Puppies</i>, reach a collective audience of more than 1.1 million readers.Chapter 1 <br><br>Brittany <br><br>Named for the French province in which it originated, the brittany was first registered by the American Kennel Club as the Brittany Spaniel in 1934. Although called a spaniel, by its manner of working game the Brittany belongs with the pointing breeds. In appearance, the breed is smaller than the setters but leggier than the spaniels, having a short tail and characteristic high ear-set. On September 1, 1982, the breed&#x2019;s official AKC name became Brittany, to more correctly identify their hunting style. <br><br>Though it is generally conceded that the basic stock for all bird dogs is the same, most of the facts concerning the development and spread of the various breeds are lost in antiquity. The first accurate records to pinpoint the actual Brittany-type dog are seventeenth-century paintings and tapestries. The frequency with which these appear suggests this type of dog was fairly common. Paintings by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686&#x2013;1755) show a liver-and-white dog pointing partridge. This same type of dog is common in Flemish paintings from the school of Jan Steen. Still other artists show this type of bird dog, so it would appear that it was common throughout the northern coast of France and in Holland. <br><br>Still, there is nothing written before 1850 that can be unequivocally interpreted as a reference to the Brittany. In that year, the English clergyman Reverend Davies wrote of hunting in Carhaix with small, bobtailed dogs. They were not as smooth as the Pointer, but worked well in the brush. They pointed, retrieved game well, and were particularly popular with poachers, as the nature of that occupation required that the dogs be easy to handle. The description fits the Brittany to perfection. <br><br>It was speculated, and in at least one case confirmed, that around 1900 some native spaniels of Brittany were mated with English pointing dogs, whose owners vacationed in France, for woodcock shooting. These matings intensified the pointing qualities of the breed while the basic features remained essentially Breton. The Brittany was an all-purpose dog, a family pet, and a guard dog as well as a hunting dog for the thrifty French peasant. This certainly influenced its shape, size, and disposition. The climate, the nature of the terrain hunted, the manner of hunting, and even its popularity with poachers all had an effect on the type of coat, keenness of nose, and retrieving ability that was developed over the years. <br><br>Legend has it that the first tailless ancestor of the modern Brittany emerged in the mid-1800s at Pontou, a little town in the valley of Douron. It resulted from a cross between a white-and-mahogany bitch owned by a hunter in the region and a lemon-and-white dog brought to Brittany for woodcock shooting by an English sportsman. Of two tailless puppies in this litter, one proved outstanding. His work in the field has been described as wonderful, and he became a popular stud. All of his litters produced puppies either without tails or with short stubs. <br><br>The Brittany became a recognized breed in 1907, when Boy, an orange-and-white, was registered in France as the first l&#x2019;�pagneul Breton queue courte naturelle. This name was soon shortened to l&#x2019;�pagneul Breton, or Brittany Spaniel. Before 1907, Brittanys had competed in classes for Miscellaneous French spaniels. <br><br>In the same year, an outline for the first breed standard was written. This early standard required that the tail be short at birth and that, in order to discourage further crossbreeding, black and white be disqualified. The requirement for the natural bobtail was soon dropped. <br><br>The breed was introduced in the United States in 1931 and was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1934. The first standard was a direct translation from the French and not particularly comprehensible. The first major accomplishment of the American Brittany Club after its formation in 1942 was to replace the original standard with a clear and concise one. <br><br>An early gain in popularity was due largely to the Brittany&#x2019;s merits as a shooting dog. A superb nose and desire to please, coupled with relatively small size, endeared the breed to rural and urban hunters alike. <br><br>The last fifty years have seen a tremendous growth in both field trials and hunt tests sponsored by the American Brittany Club under the auspices of the AKC. Brittany competition in AKC dog shows has grown equally, and the majority of Brittany owners and breeders are today dedicated to the Dual Champion (field and show champion). Now, seventy years since first recognition, more than 500 Brittanys have gained the ultimate title, that of Dual Champion. <br><br>OFFICIAL STANDARD FOR THE BRITTANY <br><br>General Appearance&#x2014;A compact, closely knit dog of medium size, a leggy dog having the appearance, as well as the agility, of a great ground coverer. Strong, vigorous, energetic and quick of movement. Ruggedness, without clumsiness, is a characteristic of the breed. He can be tailless or has a tail docked to approximately four inches. <br><br>Size, Proportion, Substance&#x2014;Height&#x2014;171D2 to 201D2 inches, measured from the ground to the highest point of the shoulders. Any Brittany measuring under 171D2 inches or over 201D2 inches shall be disqualified from dog show competition. Weight&#x2014;Should weigh between 30 and 40 pounds. <br><br>Proportion&#x2014;So leggy is he that his height at the shoulders is the same as the length of his body. <br><br>Body Length&#x2014;Approximately the same as the height when measured at the shoulders. Body length is measured from the point of the forechest to the rear of the rump. A long body should be heavily penalized. Substance&#x2014;Not too light in bone, yet never heavy-boned and cumbersome. <br><br>Head&#x2014;Expression&#x2014;Alert and eager, but with the soft expression of a bird dog. Eyes&#x2014;Well set in head. Well protected from briers by a heavy, expressive eyebrow. A prominent, full or popeye should be heavily penalized. It is a serious fault in a dog that must face briers. Skull well chiseled under the eyes, so that the lower lid is not pulled back to form a pocket or haw that would catch seeds, dirt and weed dust. Preference should be for the darker colored eyes, though lighter shades of amber should not be penalized. Light and mean-looking eyes should be heavily penalized. Ears&#x2014;Set high, above the level of the eyes. Short and triangular, rather than pendulous, reaching about half the length of the muzzle. Should lie flat and close to the head, with the tip rounded very slightly. Ears well covered with dense, but relatively short hair, and with little fringe. Skull&#x2014;Medium length, rounded, very slightly wedge-shaped, but evenly made. Width, not quite as wide as the length and never so broad as to appear coarse, or so narrow as to appear racy. Well defined, but gently sloping stop. Median line rather indistinct. The occiput only apparent to the touch. Lateral walls well rounded. The Brittany should never be &#x201c;apple-headed&#x201d; and he should never have an indented stop. Muzzle&#x2014;Medium length, about two thirds the length of the skull, measuring the muzzle from the tip to the stop, and the skull from the occiput to the stop. Muzzle should taper gradually in both horizontal and vertical dimensions as it approaches the nostrils. Neither a Roman nose nor a dishface is desirable. Never broad, heavy or snipy. Nose&#x2014;Nostrils well open to permit deep breathing of air and adequate scenting. Tight nostrils should be penalized. Never shiny. Color: fawn, tan, shades of brown or deep pink. A black nose is a disqualification. A two-tone or butterfly nose should be penalized. Lips&#x2014;Tight, the upper lip overlapping the lower jaw just to cover the lower lip. Lips dry, so that feathers will not stick. Drooling to be heavily penalized. Flews to be penalized. Bite&#x2014;A true scissors bite. Overshot or undershot jaw to be heavily penalized. <br><br>Neck, Topline, Body&#x2014;Neck&#x2014;Medium length. Free from throatiness, though not a serious fault unless accompanied by dewlaps, strong without giving the impression of being overmuscled. Well set into sloping shoulders. Never concave or ewe-necked. Topline&#x2014;Slight slope from the highest point of the shoulders to the root of the tail. Chest&#x2014;Deep, reaching the level of the elbow. Neither so wide nor so rounded as to disturb the placement of the shoulders and elbows. Ribs well sprung. Adequate heart room provided by depth as well as width. Narrow or slab-sided chests are a fault. Back&#x2014;Short and straight. Never hollow, saddle, sway or roach-backed. Slight drop from the hips to the root of the tail. Flanks&#x2014;Rounded. Fairly full. Not extremely tucked up, or flabby and falling. Loins short and strong. Distance from last rib to upper thigh short, about three to four finger widths. Narrow and weak loins are a fault. In motion, the loin should not sway sideways, giving a zig-zag motion to the back, wasting energy. Tail&#x2014;Tailless to approximately four inches, natural or docked. The tail not to be so long as to affect the overall balance of the dog. Set on high, actually an extension of the spine at about the same level. Any tail substantially more than four inches shall be severely penalized. <br><br>Forequarters&#x2014;Shoulders&#x2014;Shoulder blades should not protrude too much, not too wide apart, with perhaps two thumbs&#x2019; width between. Sloping and muscular. Blade and upper arm should form nearly a ninety-degree angle. Straight shoulders are a fault. At the shoulders the Brittany is slightly higher than at the rump. Front Legs&#x2014;Viewed from the front, perpendicular, but not set too wide. Elbows and feet turning neither in nor out. Pasterns slightly sloped. Down in pasterns is a serious fault. Leg bones clean, graceful, but not too fine. Extremely heavy bone is as much a fault as spindly legs. One must look for substance and suppleness. Height at elbows should approximately equal distance from elbow to withers. Feet&#x2014;Should be strong, proportionately smaller than the spaniels&#x2019;, with close-fitting, well-arched toes and thick pads. The Brittany is &#x201c;not up on his toes.&#x201d; Toes not heavily feathered. Flat feet, splayed feet, paper feet, etc., are to be heavily penalized. An ideal foot is halfway between the hare and the cat foot. Dewclaws may be removed. <br><br>Hindquarters&#x2014;Broad, strong and muscular, with powerful thighs and well-bent stifles, giving the angulation necessary for powerful drive. Hind Legs&#x2014;Stifles well bent. The stifle should not be so angulated as to place the hock joint far out behind the dog. A Brittany should not be condemned for straight stifle until the judge has checked the dog in motion from the side. The stifle joint should not turn out making a cowhock. Thighs well feathered but not profusely, halfway to the hock. Hocks, that is, the back pasterns, should be moderately short, pointing neither in nor out, perpendicular when viewed from the side. They should be firm when shaken by the judge. Feet&#x2014;Same as front feet. <br><br>Coat&#x2014;Dense, flat or wavy, never curly. Texture neither wiry nor silky. Ears should carry little fringe. The front and hind legs should have some feathering, but too little is definitely preferable to too much. Dogs with long or profuse feathering or furnishings shall be so severely penalized as to effectively eliminate them from competition. Skin&#x2014;Fine and fairly loose. A loose skin rolls with briers and sticks, thus diminishing punctures or tearing. A skin so loose as to form pouches is undesirable. <br><br>Color&#x2014;Orange and white or liver and white in either clear or roan patterns. Some ticking is desirable. The orange or liver is found in the standard parti-color or piebald patterns. Washed-out colors are not desirable. Tri-colors are allowed but not preferred. A tri-color is a liver and white dog with classic orange markings on eyebrows, muzzle and cheeks; inside the ears and under the tail; freckles on the lower legs are orange. Anything exceeding the limits of these markings shall be severely penalized. Black is a disqualification. <br><br>Gait&#x2014;When at a trot the Brittany&#x2019;s hind foot should step into or beyond the print left by the front foot. Clean movement, coming and going, is very important, but most important is side gait, which is smooth, efficient and ground covering. <br><br>Temperament&#x2014;A happy, alert dog, neither mean nor shy. <br><br>DISQUALIFICATIONS <br><br>Any Brittany measuring under 171D2 inches or over 201D2 inches. <br><br>A black nose. <br><br>Black in the coat. <br><br>Approved April 10, 1990 <br><br>Effective May 31, 1990<br>Pointer <br><br>The Pointer comes by his name honestly. He was the first dog, so <br><br>far as we know, used to stand game in the sense in which we use the term today, and was developed as a distinct breed much earlier than any of the setters. For years it was believed the first Pointers used in England were importations from Spain and Portugal, but that theory has been pretty thoroughly disproved. It seems far more likely that Pointers came into general use in Spain, Portugal, throughout Eastern Europe, and in the British Isles at approximately the same time. Whether or not the dogs from which they sprung were native to all these places no one can say, but it can be stated with confidence that the development of the English Pointer took place within the confines of Great Britain, most probably in England itself. Later on, Spanish Pointers were brought in, but from the first they were considered as a different strain, if not a different breed, from the English dogs. <br><br>The first Pointers of which there is any dependable record appeared in England in about 1650, some years before the era of wing-shooting with guns. The use to which they were put is interesting. Coursing with Greyhounds was a favorite sport of those times, and the earliest accounts of Pointers reveal that they were taken afield to locate and point hares. When the hare had been found, the Greyhounds were brought up and unleashed, the game was kicked from cover, and the fun began. But early in the eighteenth century, at least by 1711, wing-shooting had come into vogue, and from that day on, the &#x201c;shorthair&#x201d; has been considered by the majority of sportsmen the equal, if not the superior, of any of the gundogs. <br><br>As to the Pointer&#x2019;s lineage, as usual we find it something of an enigma, but there is no question that the Foxhound, Greyhound, and Bloodhound all had a share in his making. Individuals of the three breeds were probably crossed with the inevitable &#x201c;setting spaniel,&#x201d; which played such a prominent part in the creation of all our modern bird dogs. <br><br>During the first years of the eighteenth century the Spanish Pointer began to appear in England, and he, too, was used for a cross. But, as he was exceedingly heavy and very slow in comparison with the English, French, and German Pointers, subsequent breeding operations not only left him out but definitely attempted to correct the faults he had introduced. It appears that his real value was not to improve type but to fix and intensify the pointing instinct, in which, we are told, he was peculiarly strong.</p><h2>Women of Sufism: A Hidden Treasure</h2><p>The luminous presence of women who follow the Sufi Way&#x2014;the mystical path of Islam&#x2014;is brought to life here through their sacred songs and poetry, their dreams and visions, and stories of their efforts as they witness the Truth in many realms. These writings reflect the honor and respect for the feminine in the Sufi worldview, and they are shared in the spirit of inspiration and hope for the flourishing contributions of women to the spiritual development of humanity. <br><br>Spanning the centuries, from the time of the Prophet Muhammad to the present day, the selections are by or about an array of Sufi traditions in different parts of the world, from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East to Europe and America&#x2014;from beloved members of the Prophet's family to the mystic Rabi'a al-Adawiyya to the modern scholar Annemarie Schimmel. Biographical anecdotes and personal memoirs provide a glimpse into the experience of great saints and contemporary practitioners alike, while providing an introduction to the principles and practices of Sufism.</p><p>Camille Helminski is codirector, with her husband, Kabir Helminski, of the Threshold Society of Santa Cruz, California. She holds an honorary doctorate in Arabic from the University of Damascus and the World Union of Writers (Paris).Helminski was the first woman to publish an English translation of the Qur'an and has built a career out of reprinting classic Sufi materials. This collection of primary sources casts a spotlight on the roles women have played in Sufi history: because Sufism sheds hierarchical and social distinctions in favor of a total consummation with the Beloved (Allah), women have always held an important position, says Helminski. The collection opens with early writings about Sufi women, most of which were written by men, and some of which have only recently been made available in English. Here we learn of Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya, an eighth-century saint about whom many legends were composed, and the ninth-century healer Lady Nafisa, who was renowned for her Qur'anic knowledge and whose tomb is still a sacred destination for spiritual pilgrims of many religious traditions. Helminski goes on to offer writings by and about Sufi women up to the present day, including poetry (Rumi has some competition!), folklore, prayers, songs and journal entries. Helminski does a fine job of introducing each subject, placing each shaykha (female teacher) in her historical context and explaining why she should be remembered. Some of the contemporary women are particularly interesting, such as Russian-born Sufi author Irina Tweedie, who describes her gradual path toward Sufism. This collection of women's voices is a rich and varied resource for understanding women of "The Way." <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The New York Times Daily Crossword Puzzles (Monday), Volume I</h2><p>Monday's Crosswords Do with Ease Tuesday's Crosswords Not a Breeze Wednesday's Crosswords Harder Still Thursday's Crosswords Take Real Skill Friday's Crosswords -- You've Come This Far...Saturday's Crosswords -- You're a Star!<br><br>For millions of people, the New York Times crossword puzzles are as essential to each day as the first cup of coffee in the morning.

Love is important, not only as one of our feelings but as the transfer of all our interest in life from ourselves to another, as the shifting of the very center of our lives.... <br><br> "The meaning of human love, speaking generally, is the justification and salvation of individuality through the sacrifice of egoism. On this general basis we can also ... explain the meaning of sexual love" (Vladimir Solovyov) </blockquote> What is the meaning of love's intense emotion? Solovyov points to the spark of divinity that we see in another human being and shows how this "living ideal of Divine love, antecedent to our love, contains in itself the secret of the idealization of our love." <br><br> According to Solovyov, love between men and women has a key role to play in the mystical transfiguration of the world. Love, which allows one person to find unconditional completion in another, becomes an evolutionary strategy for overcoming cosmic disintegration.</p><p><b>Vladimir Solovyov</b> (1853-1900), one of the greatest philosophers of the nineteenth century, was the founder of a tradition of Russian spirituality that brought together philosophy, mysticism, and theology with a powerful social message.

He was also a poet and a profoundly Christian metaphysicist.

Bleached or unbleached is up to you.<br><br>Sugar is granulated. If the recipe calls for brown sugar and doesn&#x2019;t specify light or dark, use whatever you have on hand or whichever you prefer.<br><br>Butter is unsalted.<br><br>Cream is heavy or whipping cream.<br><br>Milk is whole milk. You can probably substitute 2% with good results, but I won&#x2019;t guarantee what a recipe will taste like if you use skim or nonfat.<br><br>Salt is kosher salt. If you use regular table salt, start with half the amount specified in the recipe and adjust the seasoning to your taste.<br><br>Pepper is freshly ground black pepper.<br><br>Cheese is full fat. You can use white or yellow Cheddar, whichever you prefer.<br><br>Scallions or green onions should always have the roots and tops trimmed. Unless otherwise noted, use both white and green parts.<br><br>Vegetable oil is any neutral-tasting vegetable oil, like canola or a mild olive oil.<br><br>The recipes give volume (cup, teaspoon, and tablespoon) measurements wherever possible. If you don&#x2019;t like having a half or quarter of an onion lying around, it&#x2019;s helpful to know that 1 small onion is about 1/2 cup; 1 medium onion is about 1 cup, and 1 large onion is about 2 cups.<br><br>If I know a substitution can successfully be made for an ingredient, the recipe or headnote will say so.<br><br>You can use butter or cooking spray to grease baking pans or muffin tins, whichever you prefer. I find it easier to use cooking spray on muffin tins, myself.<br><br>Several recipes call for toasted nuts or roasted garlic.<br><br>To toast nuts in the oven:<br><br>Preheat the oven to 350�F. Place the nuts in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet and bake for 5 to 10 minutes, until the nuts are fragrant. Stir or shake the pan once or twice while the nuts are toasting.<br><br>Remove the pan from the oven and cool the nuts on a plate.<br><br>To toast nuts in the microwave:<br><br>Spread 1/2 cup nuts in a single layer in a microwave-safe dish. Add 1/2 teaspoon melted butter or oil. Stir to coat the nuts. Microwave for 1 minute. Stir and microwave for another minute. Continue to microwave in 1-minute increments, stirring after each time, until the nuts are lightly browned and fragrant.<br><br>To roast garlic:<br><br>Preheat the oven to 400�F. Slice off and discard the top third of a head of garlic so that each clove is exposed. Place on a piece of aluminum foil and drizzle the garlic with olive oil. Wrap up tightly in foil, place in the oven, and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, until the center cloves are soft when pierced with a knife. Let cool for 10 minutes.<br><br>Breakfast<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always been a big fan of breakfast, because I&#x2019;m a morning person. (Okay, the truth&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m a fan of every meal.) When we were first married, Wayne asked me if I had to shine so brightly in the mornings. As I stated earlier, two kinds of people exist in this world: those who eat to live and those who live to eat. Well, I misspoke. There are also those who wake up and say, &#x201c;Good morning, God!&#x201d; and those who grouchily awaken to say, &#x201c;Good God, it&#x2019;s morning.&#x201d; I doubt you&#x2019;ll have trouble figuring out which category Wayne falls into!<br><br>Even now, with an empty nest, I make sure Wayne and I have breakfast together the same way I did when the kids were living at home. When they were toddlers, I read classic children&#x2019;s books to them each morning during their breakfast. Then the hectic mornings of school began, getting them all ready for their day, but never without a good breakfast before they headed out the door.<br><br>My own mornings start early, usually before four or shortly thereafter. I know, I know&#x2014;�it&#x2019;s early. Those predawn hours begin with Bible reading and journal writing. I&#x2019;ve kept a journal my entire life. I have three for each year: a personal journal, a gratitude journal, and a prayer journal. I write in each one every single day. This process usually takes about ninety minutes, and then I change into my swimsuit and head for the local community pool where I swim a half-mile. (Trust me, a half-mile is a lot farther in the water than on land!) Once I&#x2019;m back home, I stir Wayne into the land of the living with coffee and the promise of breakfast.<br><br>Breakfast also played a key role when I developed the premise for the Inn at Rose Harbor series. I needed to find a way to bring the guests of Jo Marie&#x2019;s inn together so that the plots weren&#x2019;t random and disjointed. Those luscious breakfasts that Jo Marie created connected the characters in the series. Over juice, fruit, muffins, and coffee, the guests bonded during their morning conversations, the same way it happens in my home.<br><br>Gratitude Bread<br><br>Makes 1 (8 x 41/2-inch) loaf<br><br>Remember the friendship bread craze from a few years back?

Add the melted butter and mix just until combined.<br><br>Scoop a heaping tablespoon of batter into each well of the muffin tins. Bake for 10 to 13 minutes, until the donuts are still pale but a toothpick inserted in the center of a donut comes out clean. <br><br>Make the coating:<br><br>While the donuts are baking, in a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar and cinnamon.<br><br>Remove the donuts from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes before removing from the tins.<br><br>Brush each donut all over with the melted butter, then roll in the cinnamon-sugar mixture.

I've rarely experienced so vividly the shunning and shaming, racism and anti-Semitism, but the surprise is how Dr. Ahmed also finds tenderness at the tattered edges of extremism, and a life-changing pilgrimage back to her Muslim faith." - Gail Sheehy<br><br>The decisions that change your life are often the most impulsive ones.<br><br>Unexpectedly denied a visa to remain in the United States, Qanta Ahmed, a young British Muslim doctor, becomes an outcast in motion. On a whim, she accepts an exciting position in Saudi Arabia. This is not just a new job; this is a chance at adventure in an exotic land she thinks she understands, a place she hopes she will belong. <br><br>What she discovers is vastly different. The Kingdom is a world apart, a land of unparralled contrast. She finds rejection and scorn in the places she believed would most embrace her, but also humor, honesty, loyalty and love. <br><br>And for Qanta, more than anything, it is a land of opportunity. A place where she discovers what it takes for one woman to recreate herself in the land of invisible women.</p><p>Dr. Ahmed is currently an assistant professor of medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, and Assistant Director of the MUSC Sleep Disorders Laboratory. She is a quadruple boarded in internal medicine, pulmonary disease, critical care medicine, and sleep disorders medicine. She continues to practice intensive care medicine. She became a fellow of the American College of Chest Physicians, a Diplomat and member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.I returned to Khalaa Tarfa, my first patient in the Kingdom. She was a Bedouin Saudi well into her seventies, though no one could be sure of her age (female births were not certified in Saudi Arabia when she had been born). She was on a respirator for a pneumonia which had been slow to resolve. Comatose, she was oblivious to my studying gaze. A colleague prepared her for the placement of a central line (a major intravenous line into a deep vein). <br><br>Her torso was uncovered in anticipation.. Another physician sterilized the berry brown skin with swathes of iodine. A mundane procedure I had performed countless times, in Saudi Arabia it made for a starling scene. I looked up from the sterilized field which was quickly submerging the Bedouin body under a disposable sea of blue. Her face remained enshrouded in a black scarf, as if she was out in a market scurrying through a crowd of loitering men. I was astounded.<br><br>Behind the curtain, a family member hovered, the dutiful son. Intermittently, he peered at us . He was obviously worrying, I decided, as I watched his slim brown fingers rapidly manipulating a rosary. He was probably concerned about the insertion of the central line, I thought, just like any other caring family member.<br><br>Every now and again, he signaled vigorously, rapidly talking in Arabic to instruct the nurse. I wondered what he was asking about and how he could know if we were at a crucial step in the procedure. Everything was going smoothly; in fact soon the jugular would be cannulated. We were almost finished. What could be troubling him?<br><br>Through my dullness, eventually, I noticed a clue. Each time the physician's sleeve touched the patient's veil, and the veil slipped, the son burst out in a flurry of anxiety. Perhaps all of nineteen, the son was instructing the nurse to cover the patient's face, all the while painfully averting his uninitiated gaze away from his mother's fully exposed torso, revealing possibly the first breasts he may have seen. <br><br>I wondered about the lengths to which the son continued to veil his mother, even when she was gravely ill. Couldn't he see it was the least important thing for her now at this time, when her life could ebb away at any point? Didn't he know God was Merciful, tolerant and understanding and would never quibble over the wearing of a veil in such circumstances, or I doubted, any circumstances? <br><br>Somehow I assumed the veil was mandated by the son, but perhaps I was wrong about that as well. Already, I was finding myself wildly ignorant in this country. Perhaps the patient herself would be furious if her modesty was unveiled when she was powerless to resist. Nothing was clear to me other than veiling was essential, inescapable, even for a dying woman. This was the way of the new world in which I was now confined. For now, and the next two years, I would see many things I couldn't understand. I was now a stranger in the Kingdom.</p><h2>Mistress of Justice: A Novel</h2><p><b><b>From the bestselling author of the Bone Collector novels, soon to be an NBC series �&nbsp;</b>&#x201c;Loaded with character and action and a very devious plot, <i>Mistress of Justice</i>&nbsp;is a top-notch legal thriller.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Mystery Lovers News<br><br></i></b>Taylor Lockwood spends her days working as a paralegal in one of New York&#x2019;s preeminent Wall Street law firms and her nights playing jazz piano anyplace she can.

In this critical anthology, the first of its kind, editors Lois Parkinson Zamora and Wendy B. Faris show magical realism to be an international movement with a wide-ranging history and a significant influence among the literatures of the world. In essays on texts by writers as diverse as Toni Morrison, G�nter Grass, Salman Rushdie, Derek Walcott, Abe Kobo, Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, and many others, magical realism is examined as a worldwide phenomenon.<br>Presenting the first English translation of Franz Roh&#x2019;s 1925 essay in which the term magical realism was coined, as well as Alejo Carpentier&#x2019;s classic 1949 essay that introduced the concept of <i>lo real maravilloso </i>to the Americas, this anthology begins by tracing the foundations of magical realism from its origins in the art world to its current literary contexts. It offers a broad range of critical perspectives and theoretical approaches to this movement, as well as intensive analyses of various cultural traditions and individual texts from Eastern Europe, Asia, North America, Africa, the Caribbean, and Australia, in addition to those from Latin America. In situating magical realism within the expanse of literary and cultural history, this collection describes a mode of writing that has been a catalyst in the development of new regional literatures and a revitalizing force for more established narrative traditions&#x2014;writing particularly alive in postcolonial contexts and a major component of postmodernist fiction.</p><p>&#34;This critical collection combines astute and graceful interpretations of well-known literary texts from the Americas while at the same time displaying a rich global understanding of the broad reach of magical realism. Fashioning subtle rethinkings of the magical realist movement, it will shape discussion of postmodern and postcolonial literary histories.&#34;--Jose David Saldivar, University of California, Berkeley<p>Lois Parkinson Zamora is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Houston.</p><p>Wendy B.

The sun was no more than a dimly glowing spot near the western horizon, framed by a lattice of bare black branches. Snow lay at least half a foot thick everywhere in the forest, muffling sound. A bird flying high on the winter wind took dim notice that the forest below him extended nearly as far as he could see no matter which way he looked, but was neatly bisected by the Trade Road immediately below him. Had he flown a little higher (for the clouds were not as low as they looked), he might have seen the rooftops and smokes of a city at the southern end of the road, hard against the forest. Although the Trade Road had seen enough travelers of late that the snow covering it was packed hard, there were only two on it now. They had stopped in the clearing halfway through the forest that normally saw heavy use as an overnighting point. One was setting up camp under the shelter of a half-cave of rock and tree trunks piled together&#x2014;partially the work of man, partially of nature. The other was a short distance away, in a growth-free pocket just off the main area, picketing their beasts.</p><p>The bird circled for a moment, swooping lower, eyeing the pair with dim speculation. Humans sometimes meant food&#x2014;</p><p>But there was no food in sight, at least not that the bird recognized as such. And as he came lower still, the one with the beasts looked up at him suddenly, and reached for something slung at her saddlebow.</p><p>The bird had been the target of arrows often enough to recognize a bow when he saw one. With a squawk of dismay, he veered off, flapping his wings with all his might, and tracing a twisty, convoluted course out of range. He wanted to be the eater, not the eaten!</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Tarma sighed as the bird sped out of range, unstrung her bow, and stowed it back in the saddle-quiver. She hunched her shoulder a little beneath her heavy wool coat to keep her sword from shifting on her back, and went back to her task of scraping the snow away from the grass buried beneath it with gloved hands. Somewhere off in the far distance she could hear a pair of ravens calling to each other, but otherwise the only sounds were the sough of wind in branches and the blowing of her horse and Kethry&#x2019;s mule. The Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in place of eternal punishment was purported to be cold; now she had an idea <i>why.</i></p><p>She tried to ignore the ice-edged wind that seemed to cut right through the worn places in her nondescript brown clothing. This was no place for a Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in of the Plains, this frozen northern forest. She had no business being here. Her garments, more than adequate to the milder winters in the south, were just not up to the rigors of the cold season here.</p><p>Her eyes stung, and not from the icy wind. Home&#x2014;Warrior Dark, she wanted to be home! Home, away from these alien forests with their unfriendly weather, away from outClansmen with no understanding and no manners&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. home.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Her little mare whickered at her, and strained against her lead rope, her breath steaming and her muzzle edged with frost. <i>She</i> was no fonder of this chilled wilderness than Tarma was. Even the Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in winter pastures never got this cold, and what little snow fell on them was soon melted. The mare&#x2019;s sense of what was &#x201c;right&#x201d; was deeply offended by all this frigid white stuff.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Kathal, dester&#x2019;edra,&#x201d;</i> Tarma said to the ears that pricked forward at the first sound of her harsh voice. &#x201c;Gently, windborn-sister. I&#x2019;m nearly finished here.&#x201d;</p><p>Kessira snorted back at her, and Tarma&#x2019;s usually solemn expression lightened with an affectionate smile.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Li&#x2019;ha&#x2019;eer,</i> it is ice-demons that dwell in this place, and nothing else.&#x201d;</p><p>When she figured that she had enough of the grass cleared off to at least help to satisfy her mare&#x2019;s hunger, she heaped the rest of her foragings into the center of the area, topping the heap with a carefully measured portion of mixed grains and a little salt. What she&#x2019;d managed to find was poor enough, and not at all what her training would have preferred&#x2014;some dead seed grasses with the heads still on them, the tender tips from the branches of those trees and bushes she recognized as being nourishing, even some dormant cress and cattail roots from the stream. It was scarcely enough to keep the mare from starving, and not anywhere near enough to provide her with the energy she needed to carry Tarma on at the pace she and her partner Kethry had been making up until now.</p><p>She loosed little Kessira from her tethering and picketed her in the middle of the space she&#x2019;d cleared. It showed the measure of the mare&#x2019;s hunger that she tore eagerly into the fodder, poor as it was. There had been a time when Kessira would have turned up her nose in disdain at being offered such inferior provender.</p><p>&#x201c;Ai, we&#x2019;ve come on strange times, haven&#x2019;t we, you and I,&#x201d; Tarma sighed. She tucked a stray lock of crow-wing-black hair back under her hood, and put her right arm over Kessira&#x2019;s shoulder, resting against the warm bulk of her. &#x201c;Me with no Clan but one weirdling outlander, you so far from the Plains and your sibs.&#x201d;</p><p>Not that long ago they&#x2019;d been just as any other youngling of the nomadic Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in and her saddle mare; Tarma learning the mastery of sword, song, and steed, Kessira running free except when the lessoning involved her. Both of them had been safe and contented in the heart of Clan Tale&#x2019;sedrin&#x2014;true, free Children of the Hawk.</p><p>Tarma rubbed her cheek against Kessira&#x2019;s furry shoulder, breathing in the familiar smell of clean horse that was so much a part of what had been home. Oh, but they&#x2019;d been happy; Tarma had been the pet of the Clan, with her flute-clear voice and her perfect memory for song and tale, and Kessira had been so well-matched for her rider that she almost seemed the &#x201c;four-footed sister&#x201d; that Tarma frequently named her. Their lives had been so close to perfect&#x2014;in all ways. The king-stallion of the herd had begun courting Kessira that spring, and Tarma had had Dharin; nothing could have spoiled what seemed to be their secure future.</p><p>Then the raiders had come upon the Clan; and all that carefree life was gone in an instant beneath their swords.</p><p>Tarma&#x2019;s eyes stung again. Even full revenge couldn&#x2019;t take away the ache of losing them, all, all&#x2014;</p><p>In one candlemark all that Tarma had ever known or cared about had been wiped from the face of the earth.</p><p>&#x201c;What price your blood, my people? A few pounds of silver? Goddess, the dishonor that your people were counted so <i>cheaply!&#x201d;</i></p><p>The slaughter of Tale&#x2019;sedrin had been the more vicious because they&#x2019;d taken the entire Clan unawares and unarmed in the midst of celebration; totally unarmed, as Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in seldom were. They had trusted to the vigilance of their sentries.</p><p>But the cleverest sentry cannot defeat foul magic that creeps upon him out of the dark and smothers the breath in his throat ere he can cry out.</p><p>The brigands had not so much as a drop of honorable blood among them; they knew had the Clan been alerted they&#x2019;d have had stood the robbers off, even outnumbered as they were, so the bandits&#x2019; hired mage had cloaked their approach and stifled the guards. And so the Clan had fought an unequal battle, and so they had died; adults, oldsters, children, all.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Goddess, hold them&#x2014;&#x201d; she whispered, as she did at least once each day. Every last member of Tale&#x2019;sedrin had died; most had died horribly. Except Tarma. She <i>should</i> have died; and unaccountably had been left alive.</p><p>If you could call it living to have survived with everything gone that had made life worth having. Yes, she had been left alive&#x2014;and utterly, utterly alone. Left to live with a ruined voice that had once been the pride of the Clans, with a ravaged body, and most of all, a shattered heart and mind. There had been nothing left to sustain her but a driving will to wreak vengeance on those who had left her Clanless.</p><p>She pulled a brush from an inside pocket of her coat, and began needlessly grooming Kessira while the mare ate. The firm strokes across the familiar chestnut coat were soothing to both of them. She had been left Clanless, and a Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in Clanless is one without purpose in living. Clan is everything to a Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in. Only one thing kept her from seeking oblivion and death-willing herself, that burning need to revenge her people.</p><p>But vengeance and blood-feud were denied the Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in&#x2014;the ordinary Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in. Else too many of the people would have gone down on the knives of their own folk, and to little purpose, for the Goddess knew Her people and knew their tempers to be short. Hence, Her law. Only those who were the Kal&#x2019;enedral of the Warrior&#x2014;the Sword Sworn, outClansmen called them, although the name <i>meant</i> both &#x201c;Children of Her Sword&#x201d; and &#x201c;Her Sword-Brothers&#x201d;&#x2014;could cry blood-feud and take the trail of vengeance. That was because of the nature of their Oath to Her&#x2014;<i>first</i> to the service of the Goddess of the New Moon and South Wind, <i>then</i> to the Clans as a whole, and only after those two to their own particular Clan. Blood-feud did not serve the Clans if the feud was between Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in and Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in; keeping the privilege of calling for blood-price in the hands of those by their very nature devoted to the welfare of the Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in as a whole kept interClan strife to a minimum.</p><p>&#x201c;If it had been you, what would you have chosen, hmm?&#x201d; she asked the mare. &#x201c;Her Oath isn&#x2019;t a light one.&#x201d; Nor was it without cost&#x2014;a cost some might think far too high. Once Sworn, the Kal&#x2019;enedral became weapons in Her hand, and not unlike the sexless, cold steel they wore. Hard, somewhat aloof, and totally asexual were the Sword Sworn&#x2014;and this, too, ensured that their interests remained Hers and kept them from becoming involved in interClan rivalry. So it was not the kind of Oath one involved in a simple feud was likely to even consider taking.</p><p>But the slaughter of the Tale&#x2019;sedrin was not a matter of private feud or Clan against Clan&#x2014;this was a matter of more, even, than personal vengeance. Had the brigands been allowed to escape unpunished, would that not have told other wolf-heads that the Clans were not invulnerable&#x2014;would there not have been another repetition of the slaughter ? That may have been Her reasoning; Tarma had only known that she was able to find no other purpose in living, so she had offered her Oath to the Star-Eyed so that she could pledge her life to revenge her Clan. An insane plan&#x2014;sprung out of a mind that might be going mad with grief.</p><p>There were those who thought she was <i>already</i> mad, who were certain She would accept no such Oath given by one whose reason was gone. But much to the amazement of nearly everyone in the Clan Liha&#x2019;irden who had succored, healed, and protected her, that Oath had been accepted. Only the shamans had been unsurprised.</p><p>She had never in her wildest dreaming guessed what would come of that Oath and that quest for justice.</p><p>Kessira finished the pile of provender, and moved on to tear hungrily at the lank, sere grasses. Beneath the thick coat of winter hair she had grown, her bones were beginning to show in a way that Tarma did not in the least like. She left off brushing, and stroked the warm shoulder, and the mare abandoned her feeding long enough to nuzzle her rider&#x2019;s arm affectionately.</p><p>&#x201c;Patient one, we shall do better by you, and soon,&#x201d; Tarma pledged her. She left the mare to her grazing and went to check on Kethry&#x2019;s mule. That sturdy beast was capable of getting nourishment from much coarser material than Kessira, so Tarma had left him tethered amid a thicket of sweetbark bushes. He had stripped all within reach of last year&#x2019;s growth, and was straining against his halter with his tongue stretched out as far as it would reach for a tasty morsel just out of his range.</p><p>&#x201c;Greedy pig,&#x201d; she said with a chuckle, and moved him again, giving him a bit more rope this time, and leaving his own share of grain and foraged weeds within reach. Like all his kind he was a clever beast; smarter than any horse save one Shin&#x2019;a&#x2019;in-bred. It was safe enough to give him plenty of lead; if he tangled himself he&#x2019;d untangle himself just as readily. Nor would he eat to foundering, not that there was enough browse here to do that. A good, sturdy, gentle animal, and even-tempered, well suited to an inexperienced rider like Kethry. She&#x2019;d been lucky to find him.</p><p>His tearing at the branches shook snow down on her; with a shiver she brushed it off as her thoughts turned back to the past. No,...</p></p><h2>The Chef Says: Quotes, Quips and Words of Wisdom</h2><p><b>Compelling quotations from 150 chefs&#x2014;including James Beard, Julia Child, Gordon Ramsay, April Bloomfield&#x2014;to inspire and delight professional chefs, foodies, and anyone who's ever resolved a crisis by adding more butter.</b><br><br>"Clean plates don't lie."<br>&#x2014;Dan Barber<br><br>Great chefs are not self-effacing or meek&#x2014;there's no room for indecision in the professional kitchen, where the slightest stumble can send an entire restaurant into the weeds.

This founder of Secessionsstil and leader of the revolt against the Viennese academies was able to achieve greater freedom in his drawings than in his more laboriously executed paintings. While there are only about two hundred completed oils, the drawings number in the thousands, and are reported to have at times quite littered his studio. He himself considered them finished works, and often exhibited them alongside his paintings.<br>Klimt's subject matter is almost exclusively the female body, naked or half clothed. For this he earned the reputation of erotic artist, and while he did not suffer the outright persecutions of his successors Schiele and Kokoschka, he was nevertheless subjected to the trials that a frankly erotic artist had to undergo in Vienna, where the everyday subject of conversation was the current love affairs of celebrities but where audiences were shocked by the sight of a dancer's naked legs. An issue of <i>Ver Sacrum</i> which reproduced one of his drawings was confiscated by the authorities. <br>The drawings reveal above all that concern of great draughtsmen from Michelangelo through Blake the marriage of subtle grace and expressive dynamism that is the human body. Like that of these two past masters, Klimt's method is essentially linear. He knew, as they did, that line, rather than shading, the creation of volume or the use of color, is the natural medium for expressing the freedom of the living human form. As he matured as an artist there was an increasing awareness of this and a greater and greater spontaneity that approached, finally, "the lightness of a net of gauze."<br></p><p></p><h2>Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash</h2><p><p>An unprecedented look at that most commonplace act of everyday life-throwing things out-and how it has transformed American society.</p><p>Susan Strasser's pathbreaking histories of housework and the rise of the mass market have become classics in the literature of consumer culture. Here she turns to an essential but neglected part of that culture-the trash it produces-and finds in it an unexpected wealth of meaning. </p><p>Before the twentieth century, streets and bodies stank, but trash was nearly nonexistent. With goods and money scarce, almost everything was reused. Strasser paints a vivid picture of an America where scavenger pigs roamed the streets, swill children collected kitchen garbage, and itinerant peddlers traded manufactured goods for rags and bones. Over the last hundred years, however, Americans have become hooked on convenience, disposability, fashion, and constant technological change-the rise of mass consumption has led to waste on a previously unimaginable scale.</p><p>Lively and colorful, Waste and Want recaptures a hidden part of our social history, vividly illustrating that what counts as trash depends on who's counting, and that what we throw away defines us as much as what we keep.</p></p><p><p><b>Susan Strasser</b> is the author of the award-winning <i>Never Done: A History of American Housework</i> and<i> Satisfaction Guaranteed: The Making of the American Mass Market. </i>Her articles have appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Washington Post,</i> and <i>The Nation</i>. A professor of history at the University of Delaware, she lives near Washington, D.C.</p>By their trash shall you know them'' is the theme of this research-driven exploration of the rubbish and refuse habits of more than two centuries of Americans. ``Rubbish took on new meanings'' in the vast transition between the preindustrial society of the 18th century and the consumer culture of the 20th, says Strasser (Satisfaction Guaranteed: The Making of the American Mass Market, 1989). She not only sorts what was trash in the 19th century, but tracks how and why what is defined as garbage expanded from a few shards of broken crockery buried in the backyard to landfills full of computers and disposable diapers. Described in detail are thrifty habits of 19th-century families, who refashioned worn or used objects of every description from broken bottles (could be made into funnels and bowls) to tired party dresses. If objects like rags and bones couldn't be reused in the home, they were sold to itinerant peddlers to be recycled into paper and buttons. Children scavenged back alleys to find castoffs, especially scrap metal, that could be sold for a few pennies. At the turn of the century, increasing class differences, the growth of manufacturing, new concern with sanitation, and the entrance of women into the marketplace with no time to refurbish worn clothing brought upheaval to trash culture. Further changes are tracked through WWI, the Depression, and WWII, when recycling fat, metal, rubber, and paper became a patriotic duty. A wave of consumerism followed WWII, and the current wave of recycling is an offshoot of the countercultural 1960s, says Strasser. Although concerned about the continuing large volume of refuse generated now, Strasser is heartened that sorting trash for disposal has been revived, this time as a moral act and not a pecuniary one. Rummaging through the trash barrel of history has unearthed some choice, if occasionally dry, morsels of 20th-century culture. (b&amp;w photos) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

There are more than 1700 <em>Bikram Yoga</em> studios worldwide that teach his exclusive style of Hatha Yoga.</p>Choudhury (<i>Bikram's Beginning Yoga Class</i>) has been called the "Bill Gates of Yoga," but readers may detect a bit of P.T. Barnum in this "hot yoga" showman. Born in India, Choudhury has lived in Hollywood since the early 1970s, when he founded his Yoga College of India. His brash style and personal wealth have drawn fire from the media and American yogis. His somewhat militant, "no pain, no gain" rhetoric and franchised, one-size-fits-all approach may seem contrary to the principles of yoga; Bikram claims his system is the most authentic yoga taught in the U.S. The Bikram Yoga sequence consists of 26 postures, two breathing exercises and brief resting periods performed in a room heated above 100 degrees. This method, Choudhury claims, can cure everything from physical injuries and serious illnesses to troubled relationships and spiritual poverty. Some readers may be put off by frequent name-dropping of famous students (Shirley MacLaine) and those who have received miraculous cures (former President Nixon). <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Corbett placed naval warfare within the larger framework of human conflict, proposing that the key to maritime dominance lies in effective use of sea lines for communications and in denying that use to the enemy. His concept &#x2014; which regarded naval strategy not as an end in itself but as a means to an end, with that end defined by national strategy &#x2014; makes this a work of enduring value.<br><i>Principles of Maritime Strategy</i> emphasizes precise definitions of terminology and ideas as the antidote to loose and purposeless discussion and the direct path to the fundamental data on which all are agreed. As Corbett notes in the Introduction, "In this way we prepare the apparatus of practical discussion; we secure the means of arranging the factors in manageable shape, and of deducing from them with precision and rapidity a practical course of action. Without such apparatus no two men can even think on the same line; much less can they ever hope to detach the real point of difference that divides them and isolate it for quiet solution."<br>Much quoted and referenced, this ever-relevant work is an indispensable resource for military professionals, historians, and students.</p><p></p><h2>Tears of a Tiger (1) (Hazelwood High Trilogy)</h2><p><b>Andy tackles his guilt and grief in the first book of Sharon M.

When star basketball player Robert Washington and his three closest friends mix drinking and driving in a postgame victory celebration, Robert is killed in an auto accident. The driver, Andy Jackson, is unable to resolve his feelings of guilt and remorse. Neither Andy's parents nor his psychologist accurately perceive the depth of Andy's depression, with tragic results--Andy, at the end, commits suicide. The story emerges through newspaper articles, journal entries, homework assignments, letters, and conversations that give the book immediacy; the teenage conversational idiom is contemporary and well written. Andy's perceptions of the racism directed toward young black males--by teachers, guidance counselors, and clerks in shopping malls--will be recognized by African American YAs. Although some heavy-handed didacticism detracts from the novel's impact, the characters and their experiences will captivate teen readers. The novel is also suitable for use in curricular units dealing with alcohol abuse, suicide, and racism. <i>Merri Monks</i></p><h2>Praying with the Church: Following Jesus Daily, Hourly, Today</h2><p><p>Scot McKnight, best-selling author of <i>The Jesus Creed</i>, invites readers to get closer to the heart of Jesus' message by discovering the ancient rhythms of daily prayer at the heart of the early church.

Scot lives with his wife, Kristen, near Chicago.The so-called "high church" branches of Christianity have practiced liturgical prayer, or prayer with set words and at set hours, for centuries. In this folksy, practical and welcoming guidebook for Protestants unacquainted with, or perhaps even suspicious of, what he calls the "prayer book tradition" of the Church, McKnight attempts to root liturgical prayer in three things: biblical practice, a theology based on "loving God and loving others" and an ecumenical sensitivity to the riches of various Christian traditions. A professor of religious studies at North Park University and a popular writer on Christian spirituality, McKnightexplores the Jewish practice of prayer, how Jesus practiced prayer and how various denominations use the Psalms and the Bible as foundations for liturgy. He also draws from his own experiences to illustrate how Christians can use prayer books grounded in the Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions. "Praying <i>with </i>the Church," he writes, "involves allowing our own prayer lives to be adjusted to the <i>sacred rhythms</i> of the Church's prayer tradition." Laced with quotations from many "real-life" users, this helpful volume concludes with a chapter on how prayer book liturgies can be adapted for individual use. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The MOs are completely different, and it seems like the officers had no connection to each other, but one frightening fact links the murders. Each body was discovered with a single playing card: the lieutenant&#x2019;s with the ten of hearts; the captain&#x2019;s, the jack of hearts. The message seems clear&#x2014;if the murderer isn&#x2019;t apprehended, the higher ranks will be next. As the invasion at Anzio begins, Billy needs to keep a cool head amidst fear and terror as the killer calculates his next moves.</p></p><p><p><strong>Author One-on-One: James R. Benn and Hank Phillippi Ryan</strong></p> <p><b>Hank Phillippi Ryan:</b> Quick! Elevator pitch. What's your new book about?</p> <p><b>James R. Benn:</b> The sacrifices that loyalty demands. For Billy, it&#x2019;s personal: his kid brother experiences war as an infantry replacement, and he has to deal with his natural protective instinct. For other characters, the sacrifices are life, limb, and spirit as GIs who have been in battle for months are thrown into the ill-conceived Anzio invasion, while a murderer stalks American officers. </p> <p>Two officers from troops stationed near Naples, Italy, have been found dead. The first was a lieutenant, found behind a supply tent with his neck snapped. The body of a captain, strangled on the same night, was left in an elegant garden. One frightening fact links the murders: each body was discovered with a single playing card. The ten of hearts with the lieutenant; the jack of hearts with the captain. </p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> Oh, tell me more! </p> <p><b>Benn:</b> The fear among officers at headquarters is that a crazed killer is working on a royal flush, with a general targeted as the ace of hearts. Billy is sent to stop the murders before they go any further and interfere with the upcoming invasion south of Rome. But he has more to worry about; his kid brother Danny has been drafted to the platoon Billy is investigating. While Billy knows his brother wants to prove himself, he's also well aware that the lifespan of a front-line infantry replacement is measured in days or even hours of combat. With the added pressure of a murderer lurking nearby, Billy has to find a way to protect Danny's life, a daunting prospect on the battleground of the Anzio Beachhead.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> So what about Billy Boyle? Where did you first "meet" him? How did you come to know him? What about him endears him to you?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> I had a hint of Billy in 1972 when I watched <i>The Godfather</i>. In the opening wedding scene, which takes place in 1945, Michael is in his Marine uniform, a highly decorated veteran, and he&#x2019;s practically ignored. The Corleone family didn&#x2019;t value service to country, only family, and I wondered, what would it have been like if Sonny was the one who had to go into the service? I promptly did nothing with that idea for thirty years. When I was ready, it was the Boston Irish, not Sicilians, who gave birth to Billy. He arrived one day, fully formed and named, with a complete backstory. Instead of the Mafia, his family is organized around the Irish Republican Army and Boston Police Department, where promotions are handed out based on connections and family loyalties. Just as he was made Detective, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor and Billy had to go to war. As far as the Boyles viewed things, no one had attacked Boston or Ireland; they saw no value in another war to help rescue the hated British Empire. They cook up a plan to have him serve out the war safely in Washington DC on the staff of a distant relative, an unknown general named Eisenhower. Things don't work out the way they planned.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> Love it. And it&#x2019;s always so revealing to hear where the first nugget of an idea comes from. And why your brain plucks it out of the universe, and understands instantly that it&#x2019;s the beginning of everything. I get goose bumps, sometimes, thinking of it. This book turned out to be about combat fatigue, right? Why did you choose that element?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> Because of a friend who's a state trooper. He was involved in two shootings, and was forced to kill his assailant each time. I saw how bravely he dealt with Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and that got me interested in what things were like for servicemen during World War II. It seems that in every war--starting with the Civil War, when it was called Soldier's Heart--we learn about the effects of violence on soldiers and then promptly forget about it before the next war. As late as 1944, army divisions in Italy did not have a single psychiatrist on their medical staffs. Today, we see the same struggles with PTSD in Iraq and Afghanistan, and lately with the proper diagnosis of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury from roadside bomb concussions.</p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> This is book six in your Billy Boyle series. Is it necessary to read them in order? Why? How has Billy changed over the books?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> No, it isn't necessary. There is a narrative arc concerning Billy and his English lover Diana Seaton, but that doesn't interfere with reading them out of order. Each book stands alone in terms of the story.</p> I think Billy has changed, in that the war has hardened him. He's suffered, and I think he's lost some of the innocence he had in the first book. But that's natural and quite necessary. This isn't <i>Hogan's Heroes</i>.<p></p> <p><b>Ryan:</b> What do you want your readers to understand or realize when they finish the last chapter?</p> <p><b>Benn:</b> The price is high. And thank God we have men and women who are willing to pay it. That evil is all around us and hides within the places where fear causes us to look away. And that Billy has paid a price for his decision--but wait, I don't want to give that part away!</p>James R. Benn is the author of the Billy Boyle World War II mysteries.

Merrick embarks on a course of anonymous philanthropy, inspired by reading the doctor&#39;s private papers. An engaging and dramatic story of personal redemption and private sacrifice, this spiritual tale has served as an inspiration for both the stage and screen.</p><p>Lloyd Cassel Douglas (1877-1951) began his writing career in midlife, after working for many years as a minister. He gained international fame with his novels Magnificent Obsession 91929) and The Robe (1942).Lloyd C. Douglas novels, many of which are also classic movies, are weft in the fabric of American culture. In Magnificent Obsession, playboy Bobby Merrick becomes a physician after causing the death of renowned brain surgeon Wayne Hudson. Hudson&#39;s death redefines Merrick&#39;s personal life even more than his professional life. Fine points in the novel, particularly medical details, are dated. Obsolescence presents a double bind for reader Durbin. Soothing and therapeutic, Durbin&#39;s interpretation conveys the story&#39;s compassion. His voice, however, lacks the passion needed to pace the story for audio. Consider Magnificent Obsession a mixed blessing. D.K.

The city of Corinth was infamous as a center of intellectual pride and moral laxity. Any church planted there was bound to have problems. The Corinthian church was no exception. Snobbishness, factionalism, insensitivity to other believers, doctrinal lookseness and overexuberance all flourished in the Corinthian church. When the apostle Paul heard about the difficulties, he was grieved bcause he had founded the church and felt closely tied to it. He therefore wrote an intense and pointed letter. In this fresh and gripping exposition of 1 Corinthians, David Prior plainly shows the relevance of Paul&#39;s letter for our times. His hope is that all churches may better live out the lordship of Christ in today&#39;s cosmopolitan world.</p><p>David Prior has pastored churches in Cape Town, South Africa, and Oxford, England, and has served as director of The Centre for Marketplace Theology in London.</p><h2>This Land Is Our Land: How We Lost the Right to Roam and How to Take It Back</h2><p>Private property is everywhere. Almost anywhere you walk in the United States, you will spot &#x201c;No Trespassing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Private Property&#x201d; signs on trees and fence posts. In America, there are more than a billion acres of grassland pasture, cropland, and forest, and miles and miles of coastlines that are mostly closed off to the public. Meanwhile, America&#x2019;s <i>public</i> lands are threatened by extremist groups and right-wing think tanks who call for our public lands to be sold to the highest bidder and closed off to everyone else. If these groups get their way, public property may become private, precious green spaces may be developed, and the common good may be sacrificed for the benefit of the wealthy few.<br><br>Ken Ilgunas, lifelong traveler, hitchhiker, and roamer, takes readers back to the nineteenth century, when Americans were allowed to journey undisturbed across the country. Today, though, America finds itself as an outlier in the Western world as a number of European countries have created sophisticated legal systems that protect landowners and give citizens generous roaming rights to their countries' green spaces.<br> &nbsp;<br>Inspired by the United States' history of roaming, and taking guidance from present-day Europe, Ilgunas calls into question our entrenched understanding of private property and provocatively proposes something unheard of: opening up American private property for public recreation. He imagines a future in which folks everywhere will have the right to walk safely, explore freely, and roam boldly&#x2014;from California to the New York island, from the Redwood Forest to the Gulf Stream waters.</p><p><b>Ken Ilgunas&nbsp;</b>is an award-winning author, journalist, and backcountry ranger in Alaska.

I plant forests of I's over pages and leave behind trails of thoughts and feelings that I think will change the world but that only succeed in embarrassing me. A historical and political book of this nature warrants a more formal and less personal style. While this book, outside of this chapter, may come across as impersonal, I do wish to say up front that it has in fact been written with passion and feeling. For me, the seemingly boring subjects of property law, land-use planning, and public access legislation are, well, personal.<br><br> Let me start by telling you about where I grew up. On the western edge of New York State, between the cities of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, is Wheatfield. Sprawling over twenty-eight square miles of mostly flat land and bordered on one end by the mighty Niagara River, Wheatfield was not too long ago a countryside of forests and cornfields.<br><br> Before white settlers moved into the area in the mid-1800s, the land was a relatively untouched forest inhabited by Native American tribes. Wheatfield's soil is well suited for growing wheat, so when the settlers arrived, wheat became a local staple. Then came the Erie Canal. Then industry grew, both in Buffalo and Niagara Falls. And in the second half of the twentieth century, the middle class fled the cities to live out the suburban American Dream. In less than two hundred years, the character of the land shifted from wild to farm to suburb.<br><br> If you drive through Wheatfield today, you might not be all that impressed. The town's schools, churches, pizzerias, ballparks, retirement homes, and shopping centers are scattered incoherently. You'd see that it's just yet another poorly planned American town, aggressively developed without aesthetic vision or forethought. Its natural beauties-of which there are plenty-are obscured by the fast roads, endless subdivisions, and RV dealership monstrosities. It is, shall we say, a town without charm. Since there is no Main Street, town center, or civic landmark, it's a stretch to even call it a "town" with all the connotations of cohesion that being a town implies.<br><br> Yet it is a place that remains happy and peaceful in my dreams, for it was-for a time at least-a boyhood paradise. My family was among the first to move into a subdivision in Wheatfield called Country Meadows. During our first couple of years in Country Meadows, my brother and I would play in a thin stand of woods between our backyard and a cornfield. In the adjoining lot, still wild and vacant, we skated on a pond in the winter and collected tadpoles from it in the summer.<br><br> A bunch of new families had just moved to Wheatfield, which back in the late 1980s was mostly farms and fields. We were all strangers. We were all trespassers. There weren't any grouchy old landowners. There weren't any exclusionary signs, rules, or customs. It was a suburb without fences. It was a countryside without guns. And it was suddenly populated by a bunch of excited working-class families who'd just bought their first homes.<br><br> My boyhood friends and I roamed over the muddied construction lots, passed through woods, and extended our little football fields and baseball diamonds onto our neighbors' newly planted lawns. We played in the neighborhood's half-constructed homes, some of us laying siege to our friends inside those plywood castles with an artillery of mud clumps. We stole scrap lumber and built forts in the woods behind my home. My family let our golden retriever out, night or day, to sniff and chase and wander where he wished, unleashed. Later, as teenagers, we walked between homes to play football on a huge stretch of grass behind our subdivision. We never thought to ask who owned that grass.<br><br> I remember the storms of cawing blackbirds that would descend to feed on our back lawn. I remember the stink of the freshly manured cornfield. I remember the humid summer nights, the smell of raw pumpkin pulp, the lawns bronzed with blankets of fall foliage. I remember the snow tunnels and snowball wars. In all of my years in Country Meadows, I can remember only one sharp word from a homeowner for trespassing. For the most part, I remember a land without fences. Without signs. Without prohibitions.<br><br> But don't let me paint too idyllic a picture. My adolescence wasn't all skinned knees and wilderness adventures. And I was no Huck Finn. I spent plenty of time inside, too, playing more than my share of video games and watching more than my share of TV. These were the 1990s, after all. There were Saturday morning cartoons, Sega games, air-conditioning, and many other things that tempted us to remain indoors. But it was also a time before the Internet, before the ubiquity of home computers, before helicopter parents, and before kids owned their own phones. My friends and I, more often than not, left the comforts of home to roam the neighborhood unsupervised to play until dark.<br><br> Our rural-suburban dream wouldn't last forever, though. As my brother and I grew up, Wheatfield's rural landscape was swiftly changing character. Nearby fields became smothered in asphalt. Forests were hacked down to make way for yet more subdivisions. Between 1990 and 2010, over three thousand housing units were added, and the town's population increased 39 percent, from eleven thousand to eighteen thousand people. It was one of the fastest-growing towns in all of New York State.<br><br> My neighborhood expanded like the rest of Wheatfield, and this is just a small sample of what has been happening in America since World War II. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, between 1982 and 2007 forty-one million acres of American forest and farmland were bulldozed, largely because of urban growth, reducing our country's forest and farmland by about the size of Wisconsin.<br><br> These days in Country Meadows there are no green spaces for kids to explore anymore. There's no more collecting tadpoles. There are no more woods for building forts, no more ponds for ice-skating. Walk the roads and you'll see new "No Trespassing" signs around the remaining woods. The dogs are all safely locked behind electric fences. There are no sidewalks or public trails. The subdivision itself is quiet, gets little traffic, and is good for a stroll. But walkers and cyclists are essentially locked inside a couple of adjacent subdivisions by a surrounding network of noisy and dangerous roads. If you happen to see someone walking or cycling outside of the development on one of these busy streets, you assume that they're either destitute or crazy.<br><br> I begin this book in Wheatfield not because the place is unusual. I begin it in Wheatfield because Wheatfield is so ordinary. Many Americans, whether in cities, suburbs, or even rural areas, lack green places and safe places to walk. Most of our cities and towns have been developed with drivers in mind, not pedestrians. Every year, vehicles kill thousands of Americans out walking. The organization Smart Growth America reported that from 2003 to 2012 more than 47,000 pedestrians were killed (sixteen times the number of Americans killed by tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes combined), and an estimated 676,000 were injured walking along roads.<br><br> Our lack of safe and peaceful walking places may contribute to our status as one of the more sedentary countries in the world. In 2010, the journal Medicine &amp; Science in Sports &amp; Exercise reported that Americans walked an average of 5,117 steps a day, almost half of what the health community recommends and far fewer than the averages of the other countries the researchers studied, including Australia (9,695), Switzerland (9,650), and Japan (7,168). According to a 2012 study by The Lancet, 41 percent of Americans qualify as sedentary for not getting the recommended 150 minutes of exercise per week. In 2015, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that, among Americans over twenty years old, 71 percent are overweight and 38 percent are obese.<br><br> Today, from my family's front door, there is essentially no practical or scenic place to walk to-no store, no community center, no church, no forest grove, no flowery meadow-so the only walkers are the recreation walkers, and we are far too few. Many of my friends, family, and neighbors have suffered as a result. People I love and care about have weight problems and diseases like type 2 diabetes. The people of my neighborhood are generally civically disengaged and socially isolated. In Country Meadows, I remember one block party from my youth, when one especially sociable family hosted a giant get-together on their lawn, with drinks for the adults and games for the kids. But that was an exception to the rule. Most neighbors don't talk or even wave hello when passing each other by. My family has lived in this neighborhood since 1989, yet we don't know the names of our neighbors just two houses down.<br><br> Don't get me wrong: Country Meadows is a good neighborhood. In Country Meadows, there is no crime or gang violence. You don't have to lock your doors when you leave the house. Kids don't even smash pumpkins anymore. But just because it's free of hardship and suffering doesn't mean that we can't call for something better-a Country Meadows, perhaps, where everyone has more access to nature, a greater sense of freedom, and better health.<br><br> Since graduating from college, I've called a number of other places home. I moved to the rolling, red-clay hills of the North Carolina Piedmont, where on the roads around me I estimate that three out of every five property owners have posted "No Trespassing" signs. Barred from these woodlands, walkers are forced to stay on winding, shoulderless roads. We walkers have to keep an eye out for reckless drivers, and we can anticipate a belligerent honk or two. In York County, Nebraska, I lived in between corn and soybean fields, where virtually every foot of green space was devoted to industrial agriculture.<br><br> One solution to our walking problems is to design better communities with safe walking in mind. Our country's leading walking organization, America Walks, is working toward this goal. And books like Jeff Speck's Walkable City and Suburban Nation discuss how we can design our cities and suburbs better. A pleasant walk to the post office, though, only gets you so far.<br><br> A more radical solution-which is the subject of this book-is "the right to roam." The right to roam is an American tradition dating back to our nation's origins, when ordinary folks had the right to walk through privately owned woods and fields, and along the coasts. While this may seem like a vestige of our past, gone forever like the flocks of passenger pigeons whose migrations once darkened our skies, there is reason for hope. In several European countries this freedom has been reborn and is thriving, suggesting that it can be reborn here.<br><br> I've fallen in love with the right to roam. Maybe it started as a boy, when I got to roam my half-built suburb as I wished. Or maybe it was later in life when I took offense at all the "No Trespassing" signs. Or maybe it was in northern Alaska, where I lived and worked and could walk wherever I wanted. With a map in one hand and a compass in the other, I walked up and over mountain passes of the Brooks Range and along the cobbled banks of the Koyukuk River, where hikers keep an eye out for moose and grizzlies lurking in the spruce forests. I drank freely from streams and rivers, I collected wild blueberries and cranberries, and I got to experience the exhilarating sense of solitude-and the bolstered sense of self-reliance-that comes from a walk alone through wilderness.<br><br> After the complete freedom of Alaska, it wasn't easy coming back to an off-limits landscape. America, to me, suddenly felt like it had too many fences, signs, and rules. So I spent my twenties seeking out our world's remaining roamable places. For a summer, I canoed across the waterways of Ontario, Canada. I hiked over the Scottish Highlands and down historic English paths. I would go back to Alaska each summer to work as a backcountry park ranger, roaming over the valleys and mountains of the roadless and pathless Gates of the Arctic National Park.<br><br> Most notably, in 2012, I embarked on a hiking journey over the proposed route of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was planned to stretch 1,700 miles over the Great Plains, from Alberta in Canada to the Gulf Coast of Texas. To walk over the pipe's route, roads wouldn't do. Rather, I'd have to cross fields, hop barbed-wire fences, and camp in cow pastures-all on private property. To go on this hike, I'd essentially have to trespass across America. I hiked over Montana grasslands, through South Dakota canyons, and across Nebraska cornfields. I watched Kansas sunsets, Oklahoma sunrises, and camped on the soft beds of Texas pine needles. Most days, I felt as though I had the whole Great Plains to myself. I walked over rolling, wide-open grasslands beneath an enormous prairie sky, where cloud-mountains sailed off into distant horizons. Every day, I'd watch herds of deer or white-bellied, dark-nosed pronghorn soar across the prairie like comets, leaving behind tails of shuddering grass. In a hayfield in Saskatchewan, I watched thousands of ducks rise and circle the field like the slow rotation of clouds before a twister touches down. It was a countryside so peaceful and so pretty that I often felt as though I was in the deep backcountry of a national park.<br><br> These places, though, are off-limits to Americans. The places I illegally hiked over and the sights I enjoyed are for the exclusive pleasure of a few farmers and ranchers. If you travel across rural America, you'll see "No Trespassing" and "Private Property" signs on trees and fence posts everywhere. And even where there are no signs, Americans know that they don't have implicit permission to visit the woods or fields surrounding their town. Long gone are the days when Americans could freely wander "through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements," as Henry David Thoreau did in the countryside around his hometown of Concord, Massachusetts.<br><br> On your next drive through the countryside, count how many people you see, whether they're working, playing, or just lounging. Look over the fields, into the forests, down the rows in vineyards and apple orchards. Perhaps you'll spot a few workers during picking time, or maybe a farmer harvesting his crops in his combine. But, for the most part, you'll see nobody. These are our unvisited countrysides. These were once theaters of activity where Americans worked and played, but now they're closed off to us by gates, barbed wire, and laws.</p><h2>A Journey Round My Skull (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p>The distinguished Hungarian author Frigyes Karinthy was sitting in a Budapest caf�, wondering whether to write a long-planned monograph on modern man or a new play, when he was disturbed by the roaring&#x2014;so loud as to drown out all other noises&#x2014;of a passing train. Soon it was gone, only to be succeeded by another. And another. Strange, Karinthy thought, it had been years since Budapest had streetcars. Only then did he realize he was suffering from an auditory hallucination of extraordinary intensity.<br><br> What in fact Karinthy was suffering from was a brain tumor, not cancerous but hardly benign, though it was only much later&#x2014;after spells of giddiness, fainting fits, friends remarking that his handwriting had altered, and books going blank before his eyes&#x2014;that he consulted a doctor and embarked on a series of examinations that would lead to brain surgery. Karinthy&#x2019;s description of his descent into illness and his observations of his symptoms, thoughts, and feelings, as well as of his friends&#x2019; and doctors&#x2019; varied responses to his predicament, are exact and engrossing and entirely free of self-pity. <i>A Journey Round My Skull</i> is not only an extraordinary piece of medical testimony, but a powerful work of literature&#x2014;one that dances brilliantly on the edge of extinction.</p><p><b>Frigyes Karinthy</b> (1887&#x2014;1938) was a Hungarian author, playwright, poet, journalist, and translator. He was the first proponent of the six degrees of separation concept in his 1929 short story, <i>L&#x2021;ncszemek</i> (<i>Chains</i>). Karinthy is known in English for his novellas <i>Voyage to Faremido</i> and <i>Capillaria</i>.

God, who knows everything, knows our needs. Why do we need to tell Him what He already knows? This is one of the most basic misunderstandings about prayer. We think the purpose of prayer is to give information to God: &#x201c;Lord, I need this and I need that&#x201d;&#x2014;when in reality the purpose of prayer is to conform us to His will.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prayer doesn&#x2019;t change God.

Yes, I realized joyfully, it certainly has. It is no longer the Ministry of DOING, but the Ministry of BEING -&#34; Hannah Hurnard with her special gift of story telling in this book Shining Hour Of Departure has given us the facts about aging and coming to grips with our usefulness in the Kingdom of God up to the very end. A great encouragement for any elderly person that finds themselves questioning their usefulness near the end of their life. This book abolishes the fear of death by focusing on the joy of life. Hurnard&#39;s early writings, Hinds&#39; Feet on High Places and the sequel Mountain of Spices have been embraced by the Christian community for decades, still ranking as Christian classics. This special letter, The Shinning Hour of Departure written in her later years says this: &#34;For several years I had been conscious that more and more of my rather older friends, and even some younger ones, had been taking their departure from this world, and, not infrequently, amongst those who remained, I had heard such wistful remarks as these: &#34;Well, of course one can&#39;t expect to do as much now as when one was younger.&#34; &#34;One doesn&#39;t want to have to lay everything down, you know, and to have nothing left.&#34; &#34;Its difficult to find oneself laid aside and put on the shelf.&#34; &#34;Its lonely when the friends of your own generation have all gone and the children are grown up and living lives of their own.&#34; Her answer to them brought them hope and purpose.

Like Faulkner's Mississippi and Cormac McCarthy's American West, Gay's Tennessee is redolent of broken souls. Mining that same fertile soil, his debut collection, <i>I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down</i>, brings together thirteen stories charting the pathos of interior lives. Among the colorful people readers meet are: old man Meecham, who escapes from his nursing home only to find his son has rented their homestead to "white trash"; Quincy Nell Qualls, who not only falls in love with the town lothario but, pregnant, faces an inescapable end when he abandons her; Finis and Doneita Beasley, whose forty-year marriage is broken up by a dead dog; and Bobby Pettijohn -- awakened in the night by a search party after a body is discovered in his back woods. <br> William Gay expertly sets these conflicted characters against lush backcountry scenery and defies our moral logic as we grow to love them for the weight of their human errors.</p><p><b>William Gay</b> is the author of the novels <i>Provinces of Night</i> and <i>The Long Home.</i> His short stories have appeared in <i>Harper's, The Georgia Review, The Atlantic Monthly, GQ, Oxford American,</i> and <i>New Stories from the South, 1999-2001.</i> The winner of the 1999 William Peden Award, the 1999 James A. Michener Memorial Prize, and the recipient of a 2002 Guggenheim fellowship, he lives in Hohenwald, Tennessee.<b><i>I Hate to See That Evening Sun Go Down</i></b> <p> When the taxicab let old man Meecham out in the dusty roadbed by his mailbox the first thing he noticed was that someone was living in his house. There was a woman hanging out wash on the clothesline and a young girl sunning herself in a rickety lawn chair and an old dust-colored Plymouth with a flat tire parked in Meecham's driveway. All this so disoriented the old man that he dropped the cardboard suitcase he was holding and forgot about paying the cab driver. He thought for a dizzy moment that he had directed the driver to the wrong place: but there was the fading clapboard house and the warm umber roof of the barn bisected by the slope of ridge and on top of that the name abner meecham on the mailbox in his own halting brushstrokes. </p><p> Looks like you got company, the cab driver said. </p><p> Beyond the white corner of the house the woman stood holding a bedsheet up to the line and she was studying him transfixed with a clothespin in her mouth. She seemed frozen to the ground, motionless as statuary a sculptor in a whimsical mood might have wrought of a sharecropper's wife. </p><p> How much was it I owed you? Meecham asked, finally remembering. He fumbled out a wallet with a chain affixed to it and a clasp hooked to a belt and turned slightly to the side as an old man does when studying a wallet's contents. </p><p> Well. Twenty dollars. That seems like a lot but it's a right smart way from Linden. </p><p> And worth ever nickel of it, the old man said, selecting at length a bill and proffering it through the window. Twenty dollars' worth of distance from Linden, Tennessee, is fine with me. If I was a wealthy man I would of bought more of it. </p><p> Glad to of brought you, the driver said. You be careful in all this heat. Meecham raised a hand in farewell, dismissal. He was already forgetting the driver and was at picking up his luggage and preparing to investigate these folks making free with his property. </p><p> As he passed the lawn chair the girl casually tucked a pale breast into her halter top. Hidy. Do I know you? She removed a pair of plastic-framed sunglasses as if she might study him more closely. </p><p> You will here in a minute. He was a fierce-looking old man slightly stooped wearing dungarees and a blue chambray workshirt. The shirt was faded a pale blue from repeated laundering and he had the top button fastened against his Adam's apple. On his head he wore a canvas porkpie hat cocked over one bristling eyebrow and the hat and his washed-out blue eyes were almost the exact hue of his shirt. Who are you people and what are you doing here? </p><p> I'm Pamela Choat and I'm sunbathin, the girl said, misunderstanding or in the old man's view pretending to. I'm gettin me a tan. Mama's hangin out clothes and Daddy's around here somewhere. </p><p> I mean what are you even doin here? Why are you here? </p><p> The girl put her sunglasses back on and turned her oiled face to the weight of the sun. We live here, she said. </p><p> That can't be. I live here, this is my place. </p><p> You better talk to Mama, the girl said. Behind the opaque lenses of the sunglasses perhaps her eyes were closed. Meecham turned. The woman was crossing the yard toward him. He noticed with a proprietary air that the grass needed cutting. He'd been gone less than two months and already the place was going to seed. </p><p> Ain't you Mr. Meecham? </p><p> I certainly am, the old man said. He leaned on his walking stick. The stick was made to represent a snake and the curve he clasped was an asp's head. I don't believe I've made your acquaintance. </p><p> I'm Mrs. Choat, she said. Ludie Choat, Lonzo's wife. You remember Lonzo Choat. </p><p> Lord God, the old man said. </p><p> We rented this place from your boy. </p><p> The hell you say. </p><p> Why yes. We got a paper and everything. We thought you was in the old folk's home in Perry County. </p><p> I was. I ain't no more. I need to use the telephone. </p><p> We ain't got no telephone. </p><p> Of course there's a telephone. We always had a telephone. </p><p> The woman regarded him with a bland bovine patience, as if she were explaining something to a somewhat backward child. There was a curiously blank look about her, the look of the innocent or the deranged. There's one but it don't work. You can't talk on it. It ain't hooked up or somethin. You need to talk to Lonzo. He'll be up here directly. </p><p> I'm an old man, Meecham said. I may die directly. Where is he and I'll just go to him. </p><p> He's down there in the barn fixin a tire. </p><p> Choat was in the hall of the barn and he seemed locked in mortal combat with the flat tire. He was stripped to the waist and he was wringing wet with sweat. His belly looped slackly over the waistband of his trousers but his shoulders and back were knotted with muscle. He had a crowbar jammed between the tire and rim and was trying to pry it free. Then he held the crowbar in position with a foot and tried to break the tire loose from the rim with a splitting hammer. Meecham noticed with satisfaction that it showed no sign of giving. </p><p> When the old man's shadow fell across the chaff and straw and dried manure of the hall Choat looked up. Some dark emotion, dislike or hostility or simply annoyance, flickered across his face like summer lightning and was gone. Choat laid the splitting hammer aside and squatted in the earth. He wiped sweat out of his eyes and left a streak of greasy dirt in the wake of his hand. Meecham suddenly saw how like a hog Choat looked, his red porcine jowls and piggy little eyes, as if as time passed he had taken on the characteristics of his namesake. </p><p> You not got a spare? </p><p> This is the spare. I believe I know you. You're lawyer Meecham's daddy. We heard you was in a nursin home. What are you doin here? </p><p> I didn't take to nursin, Meecham said. Is it true that Paul rented you folks this place? </p><p> He damn sure did. A ninety-day lease with a option to buy. </p><p> The old man felt dizzy. He was almost apoplectic with rage. He felt he was going to have a seizure, a stroke, some kind of attack. The idea of Choat eating at his table, sleeping in his bed was bad enough; the idea that he might own it, call it his, was not to be borne. </p><p> Buy? You wasn't ever nothin but a loafer. You never owned so much as a pair of pliers. That's my wreckin bar and splittin hammer right there. And if you think you can buy a farm this size with food stamps you're badly mistaken. </p><p> Choat just shook his head. He grinned. A drop of sweat beaded on the end of his nose, fell. Blackheads thick as freckles fanned out from his eyes and there were black crescents of dirt beneath his fingernails. </p><p> You still as contrary as you ever was. You remember the time I tried to rent that lit old tenant shack from you? </p><p> No. </p><p> You wouldn't rent it to me. Ain't life funny? </p><p> I never rented that house to anybody. It was built too close to the main house to begin with and there wouldn't have been any privacy for either place. That must have been twenty-five years ago. </p><p> Ever how long it was I needed it and I didn't get it. And life is funny. We aim to buy this place. I got a boy in Memphis, he's a plumbin contractor. Does these big commercial jobs. He's aimin to buy and we're fixin to tend it. And you can forget about the food stamps. He makes plenty of money. He buys and sells lawyers like they was Kmart specials. </p><p> Well I ain't seen none of this famous money. And the fact of the matter is this place ain't Paul's to sell. It's my place and will be till I die. It may be Paul's then and he can do what he wants to with it. But after this I doubt it. In fact I'm pretty sure Paul's shot at this place just went up in smoke. </p><p> They fixed it up legal. </p><p> If I was you I'd be packin up my stuff. </p><p> We'll see. </p><p> We goddamn sure will. Where's that paper? </p><p> Choat got up. It's up to the house. We'll have to go up there. </p><p> Then let's be for goin, the old man said. </p><p> The old man sat on the doorstep of the tenant house in the shade for a while and thought about things. It was almost twelve miles back to Ackerman's Field, the nearest town and the one in which Paul did his lawyering. He had no telephone. He had no car; in actuality he owned a two-year-old Oldsmobile and a four-wheel-drive cream-colored Toyota pickup, but Paul had taken them to town for storage and he expected that by now they were somewhere in Mexico with the serial numbers eradicated. He had money, but nowhere to spend it. He had a neighbor across the ridge but he was too weary to walk over there now. Choat's car had a flat tire, but he had not even factored that into the equation. Folks in hell would be eating Eskimo Pies before Lonzo Choat hauled him anywhere. </p><p> Anyway he was home, and it was good to be here. He opened the suitcase and examined its contents. A change of clothing. A razor and a can of shaving cream. A bar of soap. A toothbrush and the sort of miniature tube of toothpaste you see in motel and hospital rooms. A tin of Vienna sausages and a cellophane-wrapped package of crackers he'd brought in case he got hungry on the cab ride. It occurred to him now that he hadn't eaten since breakfast at the nursing home. </p><p> He glanced toward the house. The woman was standing in the door watching him as if she'd learn his intentions, some quality of apprehension in her posture. He looked away and he heard the screen door fall to. </p><p> The day was waning. Beyond the frame farmhouse light was fleeing westward and bullbats came sheer and plumb out of the tops of the darkling trees as if they'd harry the dusk on. A whippoorwill called and some old nigh-lost emotion somewhere between exaltation and pain rose in him and twisted sharp as a knife. As if all his days had honed down to this lone whippoorwill calling out of the twilight. </p><p> The old man sat for a time just taking all this in. Whippoorwills had been in short supply in the nursing home and it was a blessing not to smell Lysol. He breathed in deeply and he could smell the trees still holding the day's heat and the evocative odor of honeysuckle and the cool citrusy smell of pine needles. </p><p> Well, I never held myself above tenant farmin, he said to himself. </p><p> At least the lights w...</p></p><h2>Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East: 1776 to the Present</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Will shape our thinking about America and the Middle East for years.&#x201d;&#x2015;Christopher Dickey, <em>Newsweek</em></strong></p><em>Power, Faith, and Fantasy</em>tells the remarkable story of America's 230-year relationship with the Middle East. Drawing on a vast range of government documents, personal correspondence, and the memoirs of merchants, missionaries, and travelers, Michael B. Oren narrates the unknown story of how the United States has interacted with this vibrant and turbulent region. 68 black-and-white photographs, 4 maps</p><p>Michael B. Oren, Senior Fellow at the Shalem Center, has written numerous works on the Middle East, including the New York Times bestsellers Six Days of War and Power, Faith, and Fantasy. He has taught at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown universities, and currently serves as Israel&#x2019;s ambassador to the United States.The remarkable panorama of U.S. involvement in the Middle East is effectively delivered. Beginning with the singular figure of explorer John Ledyard, the author describes a popular fascination with the Orient, as the Middle East was then called, a fascination most often shattered when encountering the real thing. From missionaries to educators to physicians to presidents, Oren details the personalities of those who ventured East and the social environments each encountered in the various eras described. Norman Dietz plows through the reading with a slow cadence, only occasionally fumbling over a phrase in Hebrew or another of the various languages. In truth, he often sounds tired, like a weary grandfather, but his voice maintains a kindly and pleasant expression.

Any view of the Gem State is likely to be broadened and deepened by this superbly written history of it, <i>In Mountain Shadows</i>. Carlos A. Schwantes illustrates the extent to which Idahoans have always been divided by geography, transportation patterns, religion, and history. Although the state motto should have been "Divided We Stand," as he says in affectionate jest, it is also true that Idahoans come together on some basics&#x2014;on avoiding crowds and maintaining the good life close to scenic mountains and streams. <p>Schwantes reaches back to 1805, when Lewis and Clark were among the first white men to enter present-day Idaho. He describes the Indians then living in the Great Basin and Plateau, and proceeds through layers of history to show how fur traders, missionaries, and overland emigrants defined the land that became a territory in 1863 and, finally, a state in 1890. The vigilantism, Indian wars, mining booms and busts, and an-imosity toward Mormons and Chinese immigrants that marked the territorial years gave way to more troubles in the early years of statehood: an economic downturn, industrial violence, political protest. The arrival of automobiles promised to end isolation, but the formidable terrain slowed the building of north-south highways, just as it had railroads. Nevertheless, future Idaho would be a product of engineering and witness the coming of irrigation systems and hydroelectric plants. Schwantes brings his history through the Great Depression, World War II, and the Cold War, noting everyday life, colorful personalities, political and economic cycles, raging controversies, and current trends.</p></p><p>In this history, Carlos A.

It is a maneuver generally employing surprise and a sacrifice, in which pieces work together to bring about a sudden advantage. It is perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying and successful technique in the game. Some players believe that the combination is a spontaneous creation with no guiding laws; the possibility springs up in the mind like a flash of genius. In this classic work, however, Znosko-Borovsky proves that combinations can be studied. He demonstrates conclusively that they need not be a haphazard occurrence, but may be prepared for as an integral part of a player's game.<br>The great modern teacher begins by examining the games of master players, including Capablanca, Alekhine, Rubinstein, Nimzovich, Tarrasch, Reti, Mason, Morphy, Bird, Euwe, Emanuel Lasker, etc. The games are grouped according to common features, and perceptively analyzed to determine what conclusions may be drawn. Znosko-Borovsky shows that every combination, however complicated, begins in a simple idea, such as an undefended piece, the bad position of the hostile king, the promotion of a pawn, or a discovered check.<br><i>The Art of Chess Combination</i> will improve the game of anyone who knows how to move individual pieces but finds it hard to plan many moves ahead to make the pieces work together. The exposition is easily understood; technical terms are almost completely avoided but clarity and precision remain.<br>"In the teaching of chess he may claim to have no superior." &#x2014; Philip W.

The Historic Indian Tribes of Louisiana: From 1542 to the Present is a highly informative study that reconstructs the history and cultural evolution of these people. This study identifies tribal groups, charts their migrations within the state, and discusses their languages and customs. According to the authors, the first descriptions of Louisiana Indians are contained in accounts kept by members of Hernando de Soto's expedition In the 1540s. The next recorders of Indian life were the French in the 1700s. European influences irrevocably marked the Indians' lives. The natives lost tribal lands to the new settlers and replaced many of their weapons and tools with those of the Europeans. Diseases apparently introduced by the Spaniards decimated entire tribes and caused the disappearance of certain tribal languages that had never been recorded. However, much of Indian material culture has survived even to the present, including the dugout canoe, or pirogue, and the beautiful cane basketry of the Chitimacha tribe.According to the authors, current figures show that Louisiana has the third largest native American population in the eastern United States. Several of Louisiana's present-day Indian tribes, such as the Tunica-Biloxi, Choctaw, and Koasati, entered the state in the second half of the eighteenth century. They gradually established settlements throughout the state, at times displacing the native tribes. Today, many of Louisiana's Indians work in business and industry and as farmers and loggers.The Historic Indian Tribes of Louisiana is a valuable contribution to the literature on Louisiana History. It will be of interest to anthropologists, geographers, historians, and anyone wanting to know more about these important members of Louisiana's population.</p></p><p>From 1542 to the Present: Here is the most complete account available of the long and varied history of Louisiana&#39;s Native American population.<p>Fred B.

The fourteen leading evangelical scholars who have contributed to this volume come from various denominations and have written on a wide range of topics related to the doctrine of the inerrancy of the Bible. Believing that this doctrine is "an essential element of the authority of Scripture and a necessary ingredient for the health of the church of Christ," they have made a strong defense of it. This book is presented as an appeal to the church of Jesus Christ. To those churches that hold to the inerrancy of Scripture, it is a call to hold the line. To those churches that have given way to the persuasions of radical higher criticism, it is a call to return to the historic position of Christianity. Inerrnacy is shown to be a doctrine of crucial importance to the church. Among the chapter titles are these: Christ's View of Scripture - Alleged Errors and Discrepancies in the Original Manuscripts of the Bible - Higher Criticism and Biblical Inerrancy - Legitimate Hermeneutics - The Human Authorship of Inspired Scripture - The Meaning of Inerrancy - Philosophical Presuppositions of Biblical Errancy - The View of the Bible Held by the Church - B. B. Warfield Versus G. C. Berkouwer on Scripture -- Included as an appendix is the Statement of the Council. This Statement consists of three parts: a Summary Statement, Articles of Affirmation and Denial, and an Exposition. The intent of this declaration underlies all of the chapters in this significant book.</p></p><p>Norman Geisler (PhD, Loyola University) is president of Southern Evangelical Seminary and author or coauthor of over fifty books including Decide for Yourself, Baker&#x2019;s Encyclopedia of Apologetics, and When Skeptics Ask.</p><h2>Brigantia (3) (Vindolanda)</h2><p><p>AD 98: The bustling army base at Vindolanda lies on the northern frontier of Britannia and the entire Roman world.

Bybee, Executive Director, Biological Sciences Curriculum Study</p><h2>The Undeserving Poor: America&#39;s Enduring Confrontation with Poverty: Fully Updated and Revised</h2><p>First published in 1989, <em>The Undeserving Poor</em> was a critically acclaimed and enormously influential account of America's enduring debate about poverty. Taking stock of the last quarter century, Michael B. Katz's new edition of this classic is virtually a new book. As the first did, it will force all concerned Americans to reconsider the foundations of our policies toward the poor, especially in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2008.<br><br>Katz highlights how throughout American history, the poor have been regarded as undeserving: people who do not deserve sympathy because they brought their poverty on themselves, either through laziness and immorality, or because they are culturally or mentally deficient. This long-dominant view sees poverty as a personal failure, serving to justify America's mean-spirited treatment of the poor. Katz reminds us, however, that there are other explanations of poverty besides personal failure. Poverty has been written about as a problem of place, of resources, of political economy, of power, and of market failure. Katz looks at each idea in turn, showing how they suggest more effective approaches to our struggle against poverty. <br><br>The Second Edition includes important new material. It now sheds light on the revival of the idea of culture in poverty research; the rehabilitation of Daniel Patrick Moynihan; the resurgent role of biology in discussions of the causes of poverty, such as in <em>The Bell Curve</em>; and the human rights movement's intensified focus on alleviating world poverty. It emphasizes the successes of the War on Poverty and Great Society, especially at the grassroots level. It is also the first book to chart the rise and fall of the "underclass" as a concept driving public policy.<br><br>A major revision of a landmark study, <em>The Undeserving Poor</em> helps readers to see poverty-and our efforts to combat it--in a new light.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael B. Katz </strong>was the Walter H. Annenberg Professor of History at the University of Pennsylvania.

Katz a fine scholar, but he brings to his subject a deep empathy for the marginalized and the outcast." --Frances Fox Piven, City University of New York <br><p></p><br>"A broadly conceived and provocative review of America's recent efforts to help the poor and its return to punishing them." --Herbert J. Gans, Columbia University <br><p></p><br>"With the publication of <em>The Undeserving Poor</em>, Michael B. Katz is destined to join a select set of brilliant writers who have changed how America thinks about poverty. Like Michael Harrington's <em>The Other America</em> and William Ryan's <em>Blaming the Victim</em>, this new book has the real promise of shattering stereotypes." --Barry Bluestone, University of Massachusetts <br><p></p><br>"As students of poverty and inequality, we grew up with the classic first edition of <em>The Undeserving Poor.</em> Now, Michael Katz has undertaken a rigorous revision. But this new book is more than a second edition. It is an extraordinary analysis of shifts in academic research and political paradigms, as well as a global perspective on the question of poverty in America. Katz once again demonstrates that he is one of the most influential and creative social historians of our times." --Ananya Roy, University of California, Berkeley, and author of <em>Poverty Capital</em><p></p><br>"Michael Katz has done a magnificent job of revising his classic text. It draws on a remarkable range of new material while retaining the clarity, historical perspective, and ethical sensibilities of the original. Everybody, from beginning student to seasoned expert, has something to learn from this important book."--Alice O'Connor, University of California, Santa Barbara <br><p></p><br>"With the 50th anniversary of the War on Poverty just around the corner, the hawks and doves of that 'conflict' are sharpening their arguments. All of them should read this classic of American policy, research, and public attitudes on poverty. Michael Katz, the pre-eminent scholar of the subject, has fully updated this indispensable volume right up to the moment."--Peter Edelman, author of <em>So Rich So Poor</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is social history at its best. Katz excavates the political and ideological battles over what we should do to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class. Like a good drama, it is filled with fascinating people: politicians, writers, policy wonks, activists, academics, philanthropists, and journalists. Their personalities, interests, ideas, and conflicts have shaped how we view the poor and what we do about poverty. Katz makes it all come alive in this absorbing and well-written book." --Peter Dreier, Chair, Urban &amp; Environmental Policy Department, Occidental College <br><p></p><br>"The original edition of <em>The Undeserving Poor</em> profoundly influenced two generations of poverty scholars and policy-makers. Full of fresh research and thoroughly re-written to incorporate the insights of feminist scholars, critical race theorists, economists, geographers, political philosophers and poverty historians, this new edition is as indispensable as the first. At a time when poverty rates are skyrocketing, Katz's insight and vast knowledge are more critical than ever." --Annelise Orleck, author of <em>Storming Caesars Palace: How Black Mothers Fought Their Own War on Poverty</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Katz has written a provocative, insightful, and much-needed update to the first edition of his <em>The Undeserving Poor</em> (1990)... Katz convincingly argues that the itneraction among political economy, resources, and power offer clues to addressing these questions, and that ad hoc deliberation, rather than ineffective consistency that has dogged past efforts to combat poverty, must be the order of the day. Summing up: Highly recommended." --<em>CHOICE</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Story Grammar for Elementary School: A Sentence-Composing Approach: A Student Worktext</h2><p><strong></strong> Don and Jenny Killgallon's sentence-composing approach has transformed how writing is taught in thousands of elementary classrooms, helping students all across America develop into more proficient and sophisticated writers. Now in this unique, powerful student worktext, the Killgallons use their highly effective method to link good writing to that perennially difficult-to-teach subject-grammar.<br> <br> <em>Story Grammar for Elementary School: A Sentence Composing Approach</em> offers varied practice in building better sentences by exploring and imitating the grammatical structures of children's favorite stories, including <em>Harry Potter, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Chronicles of Narnia, Bridge to Terabithia, How to Eat Fried Worms, Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Hobbit</em>, <em>A Wrinkle in Time,</em> and hundreds more.<br> <br> A narrative treasury in miniature, <em>Story Grammar</em> teaches the story in the sentence (interesting content) plus the sentence in the story (grammatical structure). It links stories and grammar in ways that are innovative-and fun. Through chunking, combining, unscrambling, imitating, and expanding, students learn and use the same grammar authors use to build sentences. No Dick-and-Jane sentences here. Instead, engaging sentences from stories for students to imitate.<br> <br> An online teacher's guide accompanies <em>Story Grammar for Elementary School: A Sentence-Composing Approach</em> and includes advice, tips, resources, answer keys, and even curricular plans for teachers who are either new to the Killgallon approach or sentence-composing veterans. No one can forge the link between grammar and writing like Don and Jenny Killgallon.

The region was colonized over the course of five centuries by a revolving cast of Spanish, Dutch, French, and English forces, who imported first African slaves and later Asian indentured laborers to help realize the economic promise of sugar, coffee, and tobacco. <i>The Caribbean: A History of the Region and Its Peoples</i> offers an authoritative one-volume survey of this complex and fascinating region.<br> <br> This groundbreaking work traces the Caribbean from its pre-Columbian state through European contact and colonialism to the rise of U.S. hegemony and the economic turbulence of the twenty-first century. The volume begins with a discussion of the region&#x2019;s diverse geography and challenging ecology and features an in-depth look at the transatlantic slave trade, including slave culture, resistance, and ultimately emancipation. Later sections treat Caribbean nationalist movements for independence and struggles with dictatorship and socialism, along with intractable problems of poverty, economic stagnation, and migrancy.<br> <br> Written by a distinguished group of contributors, <i>The Caribbean</i> is an accessible yet thorough introduction to the region&#x2019;s tumultuous heritage which offers enough nuance to interest scholars across disciplines. In its breadth of coverage and depth of detail, it will be the definitive guide to the region for years to come.</p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Stephan Palmi� </b>is professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago, specializing in Afro-Caribbean cultures.

The great minds we meet include Ren� Descartes, traditionally seen as the founder of modern philosophy; the great British philosophers Hobbes, Locke, and Hume; continental thinkers such as Spinoza, Liebniz, and Hegel; and the towering figure of Immanuel Kant, who perhaps more than any other made philosophy what it is today. Kenny first tells the story of modern philosophy chronologically: his lively, accessible narrative brings the philosophers to life and fills in the historical and intellectual background to their work. It is ideal as the first thing to read for someone new to this wonderfully creative period. Kenny then backtracks to look closely at each of the main areas of philosophical exploration in this period: knowledge and understanding; the nature of the physical universe; metaphysics (the most fundamental questions there are about existence); mind and soul; the nature and content of morality; political philosophy; and God. <br> The book also features many intriguing and beautiful illustrations which evoke the human and social side of philosophy. Anyone who is interested in the evolution of modern thought will find this a book a treasure.<br></p><p><br><strong>Sir Anthony Kenny</strong> is one of Britain's most distinguished academic figures.

By the early seventeenth century their descendants controlled territories that encompassed much of the Muslim world, stretching from the Balkans and North Africa to the Bay of Bengal and including a combined population of between 130 and 160 million people. This book is the first comparative study of the politics, religion, and culture of these three empires between 1300 and 1923. At the heart of the analysis is Islam, and how it impacted on the political and military structures, the economy, language, literature and religious traditions of these great empires. This original and sophisticated study provides an antidote to the modern view of Muslim societies by illustrating the complexity, humanity and vitality of these empires, empires that cannot be reduced simply to religious doctrine.</p><p>Between 1453 and 1526 Muslims founded three major states in the Mediterranean, Iran and South Asia: respectively the Ottoman, Safavid, and Mughal empires.

The ghosts of Marcus Garvey and King Edward VII are there too, drinking whiskey and playing solitaire. No one sees that Fall-down is Bob Marley, no one but his long-ago love, the deaf woman, Leenah, and, in the way of this otherworldly book, when Bob steps into the street each day, five years have passed. Jah ways are mysterious ways, from Kingston&#x2019;s ghettoes to London, from Haile Selaisse&#x2019;s Ethiopian palace and back to Jamaica, Marcia Douglas&#x2019;s mythical reworking of three hundred years of violence is a ticket to the deep world of Rasta history.

The knowledge guarded by these schools-passed down through the ages, and revised from time to time by great teachers-is a secret traditional science that studies the causes that lie behind observable phenomena. <p>Dion Fortune reveals every aspect of these secret organizations and the training they offer to initiates. </p><p><b>Revised edition contains a new introduction by Gareth Knight, and an index.</b></p></p><p>People have been interested in secret traditions since the beginning of time. Fraternal brotherhoods and sisterhoods, and secret orders of varying degrees exist in every country, race, and religion. Dion Fortune, in Esoteric Orders and Their Work, gets to the root of exactly what esoteric orders are, leaving no stone unturned. "Esotericism, Occultism, and Mysticism" defines what esotericism is in relation to exoteriscism; in layman's terms, the inner life versus the outer one. In "The Origin of the Mysteries", she looks at how esotericism grew hand-in-hand with the evolution of humankind, discussing how humans evolved from a group soul (still present in animals today, i.e.: packs of wolves) into a singular soul. "The Paths of the Western Tradition" is a discussion on the different schools that have developed (known as Rays) and how students, after having formed a solid base of knowledge, work through each ray on their way to becoming closer to an esoteric ideal. She expounds upon Masters in "The Evolution and Functions of the Masters". We discover that they are not so much superhuman entities as beings who have learned all they need to know on the physical plane and now teach from the ethereal. Chapters such as "The Right and Left-Hand Paths" and "The Use and Power of Ritual" explain the differences between Black and White Occultism, and how long-kept-secret rituals taught only to initiates are used to further the order's members along their paths.<p>Today, in the centers of the civilized world, there is renewed interest in esoteric schools, and although they may be misunderstood by the mainstream, some of the noblest people have been among their advocates. This book removes the shroudof mystery and fear from esotericism, and makes the Western Mystery Tradition accessible to anyone who has ever been curious about this fascinating spiritual path! Revised edition contains a new foreword by Gareth Knight, and an index.</p><p>Dion Fortune (1891-1946), founder of The Society of the Inner Light, is recognized as one of the most luminous figures of 20th-century esoteric thought. A prolific writer, pioneer psychologist, powerful psychic, and spiritualist, she dedicated her life to the revival of the Western Mystery Tradition. She was also a member of the Order of the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W.B.

The Prince had died in 1861, and had seen only the beginnings of his ambitious project for a gathering of museums in which the British craftsmen could study the best examples of design. His portrait, modest and medalled,was done inmosaic in the tympanum of a decorative arch at one end of the narrowgallery which ran above the space of the South Court. The South Court was decorated with further mosaics, portraits of painters, sculptors, potters, the "Kensington Valhalla." The third boy was squatting beside one of a series of imposing glass cases displaying gold and silver treasures. Tom, the younger of the two looking down, thought of Snow White in her glass coffin. He thought also, looking up at Albert, that the vessels and spoons and caskets, gleaming in the liquid light under the glass, were like a resurrected kingly burial hoard. (Which, indeed, some of them were.) They could not see the other boy clearly, because he was on the far side of a case. He appeared to be sketching its contents.<br><br>Julian Cain was at home in the South Kensington Museum. His father, Major Prosper Cain, was Special Keeper of Precious Metals.<br>Julian was just fifteen, and a boarder at Marlowe School, but was home recovering from a nasty bout of jaundice. He was neither tall nor short, slightly built, with a sharp face and a sallow complexion, even without the jaundice. He wore his straight black hair parted in the centre, and was dressed in a school suit. Tom Wellwood, boyish in Norfolk jacket and breeches, was about two years younger, and looked younger than he was, with large dark eyes, a soft mouth and a smooth head of dark gold hair. The two had not met before. Tom's mother was visiting Julian's father, to ask for help with her research. She was a successful authoress of magical tales. Julian had been deputed to show Tom the treasures. He appeared to be more interested in showing him the squatting boy.<br><br>"I said I'd show you a mystery."<br><br>"I thought you meant one of the treasures."<br><br>"No, I meant <i>him</i>. There's something shifty about him. I've been keeping an eye on him. He's up to something."<br><br>Tom was not sure whether this was the sort of make-believe his own family practised, tracking complete strangers and inventing stories about them. He wasn't sure if Julian was, so to speak, <i>playing</i> at being responsible.<br><br>"What does he do?"<br><br>"He does the Indian rope trick. He disappears. Now you see him, now you don't. He's here every day. All by himself. But you can't see where or when he goes."<br><br>They sidled along the wrought-iron gallery, which was hung with thick red velvet curtains. The third boy stayed where he was, drawing intently. Then he moved his position, to see from another angle. He was hay-haired, shaggy and filthy. He had cut-down workmen's trousers, with braces, over a flannel shirt the colour of smoke, stained with soot. Julian said<br><br>"We could go down and stalk him. There are all sorts of odd things about him. He looks very rough. He never seems to go anywhere but here. I've waited at the exit to see him leave, and follow him, and he doesn't seem to leave. He seems to be a permanent fixture." <br><br>The boy looked up, briefly, his grimy face creased in a frown. Tom said<br><br>"He <i>concentrates.</i>"<br><br>"He never talks to anyone that I can see. Now and then the art students look at his drawings. But he doesn't chat to them. He just creeps about the place. It's sinister."<br><br>"Do you get many robberies?"<br><br>"My father always says the keepers are criminally casual with the keys to the cases. And there are heaps and heaps of stuff lying around waiting to be catalogued, or sent to Bethnal Green. It would be terribly easy to sneak off with things. I don't even know if anyone would notice if you did, not with some of the things, though they'd notice quickly enough if anyone made an attempt on the Candlestick."<br><br>"Candlestick?"<br><br>"The Gloucester Candlestick. What he seems to be drawing, a lot of the time. The lump of gold, in the centre of that case. It's ancient and unique. I'll show it to you. We could go down, and go up to it, and disturb him." Tom was dubious about this. There was something tense about the third boy, a tough prepared energy he didn't even realise he'd noticed.<br><br>However, he agreed. He usually agreed to things. They moved, sleuthlike, from ambush to ambush behind the swags of velvet. They went under Prince Albert, out onto the turning stone stairs, down to the South Court. When they reached the Candlestick, the dirty boy was not there.<br><br>"He wasn't on the stairs," said Julian, obsessed.<br><br>Tom stopped to stare at the Candlestick. It was dully gold. It seemed heavy. It stood on three feet, each of which was a long-eared dragon, grasping a bone with grim claws, gnawing with sharp teeth. The rim of the spiked cup that held the candle was also supported by open-jawed dragons with wings and snaking tails. The whole of its thick stem was wrought of fantastic foliage, amongst which men and monsters, centaurs and monkeys, writhed, grinned, grimaced, grasped and stabbed at each other. A helmeted, gnomelike being, with huge eyes, grappled the sinuous tail of a reptile. There were other human or kobold figures, one<br>in particular with long draggling hair and a mournful gaze. Tom thought immediately that hismotherwould need to see it. He tried, and failed, to memorise the shapes. Julian explained. It had an interesting history, he said. No one knew exactly what it was made of. It was some kind of gilt alloy. Itwas probable that it had been made in Canterbury&#x2014;modelled in wax and cast&#x2014;but apart from the symbols of the evangelists on the knop, it appeared not to be made for a religious use. It had turned up in the cathedral in Le Mans, from where it had disappeared during the French Revolution. A French antiquary had sold it to the Russian Prince Soltikoff. The South KensingtonMuseum had acquired it from his collection in 1861. There was nothing, anywhere, like it.<br><br>Tom did not know what a knop was, and did not know what the symbols of the evangelists were. But he saw that the thing was a whole world of secret stories. He said his mother would like to see it. It might be just what she was looking for. He would have liked to touch the heads of the dragons.<br><br>Julian was looking restlessly around him. There was a concealed door, behind a plaster cast of a guarding knight, on a marble plinth. It was slightly ajar, which he had never seen before. He had tried its handle, and it was always, as it should be, since it led down to the basement storerooms and workrooms, locked.<br><br>"I bet he went down there."<br><br>"What's down there?"<br><br>"Miles and miles of passages and cupboards and cellars, and things being moulded, or cleaned, or just kept. Let's stalk him."<br><br>There was no light, beyond what was cast on the upper steps from the door they had opened. Tom did not like the dark. He did not like transgression. He said "We can't see where we're going."<br><br>"We'll leave the door open a crack."<br><br>"Someone may come and lock it. We may get into trouble."<br><br>"We won't. I <i>live</i> here."<br><br>They crept down the uneven stone steps, holding a thin iron rail. At the foot of the staircase they found themselves cut off by a metal grille, beyond which stretched a long corridor, now vaguely visible as though there was a light-source at the other end. The passage was roofed with Gothic vaulting, like a church crypt, but finished in white glazed industrial bricks. Julian gave the grille an irritated shake and it swung open. He observed that this, too, should have been locked. Someone was in for trouble.<br><br>The passage opened into a dusty vault, crammed with a crowd of white effigies, men, women and children, staring out with sightless eyes. Tom thought they might be prisoners in the underworld, or even the damned. They were closely packed; the boys had to worm their way between them. Beyond this funereal chamber, two corridors branched. There was more light to the left, so they went that way, negotiated another unlocked grille, and found themselves in a treasure-house of vast gold and silver vessels, croziers, eagle-winged lecterns, fountains, soaring angels and grinning cherubs. "Electrotypes," whispered the knowledgeable Julian. A faint but steady light rippled over the metal, through little glass roundels let into the brickwork. Julian put his finger<br>to his lips and hissed to Tom to keep still. Tom steadied himself against a silver galleon, which clanged. He sneezed.<br><br>"Don't <i>do</i> that."<br><br>"I can't help it. It's the dust."<br><br>They crept on, took a left, took a right, had to force their way between thickets of what Tom thought were tomb railings, surmounted by jaunty female angel-busts,with wings and pointed breasts. Julian said they were cast-iron radiator covers, commissioned from an ironmaster in Sheffield. "Cost a packet, down here because someone thought they were <i>obtrusive</i>," he whispered. "Which way now?"<br><br>Tom said he had no idea. Julian said they were lost, no one would find them, rats would pick their bones. Someone sneezed. Julian said<br><br>"I told you, don't <i>do</i> that."<br><br>"I didn't. It must have been him."<br><br>Tom was worried about hunting down a probably harmless and innocent boy. He was also worried about encountering a savage and<br>dangerous boy.<br><br>Julian cried "We knowyou're there. Come out and give yourself up!"<br><br>He was alert and smiling, Tom saw, the successful seeker or catcher in games of pursuit.<br><br>There was a silence. Another sneeze. A slight scuffling. Julian and<br><br>Tom turned to look down the other fork of the corridor, which was obstructed by a forest of imitation marble pillars, made to support busts or vases. A wild face, under a mat of hair, appeared at knee height, framed between fake basalt and fake obsidian.<br><br>"You'd better come out and explain yourself," said Julian, with complete certainty. "You're trespassing. I should get the police."<br><br>The third boy came out on all fours, shook himself like a beast, and stood up, supporting himself briefly on the pillars. He was about Julian's height. He was shaking, whether with fear or wrath Tom could not tell. He pushed a dirty hand across his face, rubbing his eyes, which even in the gloom could be seen to be red-rimmed. He put his head down, and tensed. Tom saw the thought go through him, he could charge the two of them, head-butt them and flee down the corridors. He didn't move and didn't answer.<br><br>"What are you doing down here?" Julian insisted.<br><br>"I were hiding."<br><br>"Why? Hiding from who?"<br><br>"Just hiding. I were doing no harm. I move carefully. I don't disturb things."<br><br>"What's your name? Where do you live?"<br><br>"My name's Philip. Philip Warren. I suppose I live here. At present."<br><br>His voice was vaguely north country.Tomrecognised it, but couldn't place it. He was looking at them much as they were looking at him, as though he couldn't quite grasp that they were real. He blinked, and a tremor ran through him. Tom said<br><br>"You were drawing the Candlestick. Is that what you came for?"<br><br>"Aye."<br><br>He was clutching a kind of canvas satchel against his chest, which presumably contained his sketching materials. Tom said<br><br>"It's an amazing thing, isn't it? I hadn't seen it before."<br><br>The other boy looked him in the eye, then, with a flicker of a grin.<br><br>"Aye. Amazing, it is."<br><br>Julian spoke severely.<br><br>"You must come and explain yourself to my father."<br><br>"Oh, your <i>father</i>. Who's he, then?"<br><br>"He's Special Keeper of Precious Metals."<br><br>"Oh. I see."<br><br>"You must come along with us."<br><br>"I see I must. Can I get my things?"<br><br>"Things?" Julian sounded doubtful for the first time. "You mean, you've been <i>living</i> down here?"<br><br>"S'what I said. I got nowhere else to go. I'd rather not sleep on t'streets. I come here to draw. I saw the Museum was for workingmen to see well-made things. I mean to get work, I do, and I need drawings to show . . . I like these things."<br><br>"Can we see the drawings?" asked Tom.<br><br>"Not in this light. Upstairs, if you're interested. I'll get my things, like I said."<br><br>He ducked, and began to make his way back amongst the pillars, crouching and weaving expertly. Tom was put in mind of dwarves in mine-workings, and, since his upbringing was socially conscientious, of children in mines, pulling trucks on hands and knees. Julian was on Philip's heels. Tom followed.<br><br>"Come in," said the grimy boy, at the opening of a small storeroom, making a welcoming gesture, possibly mocking, with an arm. The storeroom contained what appeared to be a small stone hut, carved and ornamented with cherubim and seraphim, eagles and doves, acanthus and vines. It had its own little metal gate, with traces of gilding on the rusting iron.<br><br>"Convenient," said Philip. "It has a stone bed. I took the liberty of borrowing some sacks to keep warm. I'll put 'em back, naturally, where I found them."<br><br>"It's a tomb or shrine," said Julian. "Russian, by the look of it. There must have been some saint on that table, in a glass case or a reliquary.<br><br>He might still be in there, underneath, his bones that is, if he wasn't incorrupt."<br><br>"I haven't noticed him," said Philip, flatly. "He hasn't bothered me."<br><br>Tom said "Are you hungry? What do you eat?"<br><br>"Once or twice I got to help in the tea-room, moving plates and washing them. People leave a lot on their plates, you'd be surprised. And the young ladies from the Art School took notice of my drawings and sometimes they passed me a sandwich. I don't beg. I did steal one, once, when I was desperate, an egg-and-cress sandwich. I were pretty sure the<br>young lady had no intention of eating it."<br><br>He paused.<br><br>"It isn't <i>much</i>," he said. "I'm hungry, yes."<br><br>He was rummaging behind the tomb in the shrine, and came out with another canvas satchel, a sketch-book, a candle stub and what looked like a roll of clothing, tied with string.<br><br>"How did you get in?" Julian persisted.<br><br>"Followed the horses and carts. You know, they turn in and drive down a ramp into these underground parts. And they unload and pack things with a deal of bustle, and it's easy enough to mingle wi' them, wi' the carters and lads, and get in."<br><br>"And the upstairs door?" Julian queried. "Which is meant to be locked at all times."<br><br>"I came across a little key."<br><br>"<i>Came across</i>?"<br><br>"Aye. Came across. I'll give it back. Here, take it."<br><br>Tom said<br><br>"It must be horribly frightening, down here alone at night."<br><br>"Not near so frightening as t'streets in t'East End. Not near."<br><br>Julian said "Please come with me now. You must come and explain all this to my father. He's talking to Tom's mother. This is Tom. Tom Wellwood. I'm Julian Cain."</p><h2>Comrade: An Essay on Political Belonging</h2><p><b>When people say &#x201c;comrade,&#x201d; they change the world</b><br><br>In the twentieth century, millions of people across the globe addressed each other as &#x201c;comrade.&#x201d; Now, among the left, it&#x2019;s more common to hear talk of &#x201c;allies.&#x201d; In <i>Comrade</i>, Jodi Dean insists that this shift exemplifies the key problem with the contemporary left: the substitution of political identity for a relationship of political belonging that must be built, sustained, and defended.<br><br> Dean offers a theory of the comrade. Comrades are equals on the same side of a political struggle. Voluntarily coming together in the struggle for justice, their relationship is characterized by discipline, joy, courage, and enthusiasm. Considering the egalitarianism of the comrade in light of differences of race and gender, Dean draws from an array of historical and literary examples such as Harry Haywood, C.L.R. James, Alexandra Kollontai, and Doris Lessing. She argues that if we are to be a left at all, we have to be comrades.</p><p><b>Jodi Dean</b> teaches political, feminist, and media theory in Geneva, New York. She has written or edited thirteen books, including <i>The Communist Horizon</i> and <i>Crowds and Party</i>, both published by Verso.&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t shut up about <i>Comrade</i>, a brilliant and hopeful book. In her sharp critique of neoliberalism&#x2019;s creepy capture of left politics and relations, Jodi Dean points the way forward with clarity, humor and joy. This is the book that the left urgently needs right now, and I can't wait to make everyone read it.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Liza Featherstone, columnist, <i>The Nation</i> and <i>Jacobin</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;In this era of hashtag politics, branding, and call out culture, when &#x2018;identity politics&#x2019; functions more like enclosure than grounds for solidarity, when planetary annihilation is deemed inevitable and racism permanent, Jodi Dean recovers the keyword absent from our radical vocabulary: Comrade. Her guided tour through communist histories reveals the power of comrade as a form of revolutionary belonging, a mode of address, a great equalizer, and an expression of disciplined and committed love distinct from eros, philia, and agape. Read <i>Comrade</i>. Be Comrades!&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Robin D.G. Kelley, author of <i>Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Tradition</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Comrade&#x2014;both a nom de guerre and a sign of love. One which constructs political organisation and struggle, and which brings back from the grave the fallen heroes.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Antonio Negri, co-author of <i>Empire</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Part speculative conceptual history and part militant political theory continuing in the same vein as her previous publications <i>The Communist Horizon</i> and <i>Crowds and Party</i>, this new book on the generic figure of the comrade as a form of address, an index of belonging, and a carrier of expectations presents Jodi Dean at her very best: witty from beginning to end, scathing as need be against those who would prefer to hamper, mock, or red-bait the prospects of egalitarian communist and socialist politics, and never less than urgently needed as a program for common struggle in these times of renewed authoritarianism, unabashed sexism, and emboldened racism.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Bruno Bosteels, author of <i>The Actuality of Communism</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Rarely has the notion of &#x2018;comrade,&#x2019; symbolic, imaginary and concrete, been more needed than now. In this vivid, elegant and persuasive text, Jodi Dean confronts the dystopic present to insist upon the necessity for building unifying solidarities across our proliferating political differences. <i>Comrade</i> is essential reading for all those committed to a politics of hope in any inclusive emancipatory and egalitarian struggles.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Lynne Segal, author of <i>Radical Happiness: Moments of Collective Joy</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;For Jodi Dean, the word &#x2018;comrade&#x2019; is by no means a simple descriptor, nor is it some dusty relic of the bygone days of actually-existing state socialism.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Maximillian Alvarez, <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></b></p><h2>Practical Criticism: A Study Of Literary Judgment</h2><p>A landmark of twentieth-century criticism that provided new standards and new techniques for examining literature. "Richards is a master of the psychology of criticism" (Saturday Review). Index.<br></p><p>Ivor Armstrong Richards (26 February 1893 in Sandbach, Cheshire &#x2013; 7 September 1979 in Cambridge) was an influential English literary critic and rhetorician. His books, especially <i>The Meaning of Meaning</i>, <i>Principles of Literary Criticism</i>, <i>Practical Criticism</i>, and <i>The Philosophy of Rhetoric</i>, proved to be founding influences for the New Criticism. The concept of 'practical criticism' led in time to the practices of close reading, what is often thought of as the beginning of modern literary criticism. Richards is regularly considered one of the founders of the contemporary study of literature in English.</p><h2>Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant</h2><p>Always innovative, often provocative, and frequently polarizing, Andrea Dworkin has carved out a unique position as one of the women&#39;s movement&#39;s most influential figures, from the early days of consciousness-raising to the &#34;post-feminist&#34; present. Heartbreak reveals for the first time the personal side of Dworkin&#39;s lifelong journey as an activist and a writer. By turns wry, spirited, and poignant, Dworkin tells the story of how she evolved from a childhood lover of music and books into a college activist, embraced her role as an international advocate for women, and emerged as a maverick thinker at odds with both the liberal left and the mainstream women&#39;s movement. Throughout, Dworkin displays a writer&#39;s genius for expressing emotional truth and an intellectual&#39;s gift for conveying the excitement of ideas and words. Beautifully written and surprisingly intimate, Heartbreak is a portrait of a soul, and a mind, in the making.</p><p><b>Andrea Dworkin</b> was the co-author, with Catharine A. MacKinnon, of civil rights legislation recognizing pornography as legally actionable sex discrimination. She wrote eleven books, including <i>Pornography</i>, <i>Heartbreak</i>, and <i>Scapegoat</i>. She died in April 2005 in Washington, D.C. Ariel Levy is a contributing editor at <i>New York</i> magazine, and the author of <i>Female Chauvinist Pigs</i>. She lives in New York City.In this roughly chronological account of her political formation, Dworkin, a prolific writer and ardent antipornography activist, shares the moments her "memory insists on," things "it will not let go." Thus, from grade school through college (what she calls "the archetypical brothel"), there are sexually predatory teachers, morally bankrupt intellectuals and plenty of molested and "incested" victims. The moral compass of these anecdotes can be dizzying. Dworkin's pedophilic high school teacher running a "menage a quatre" with a couple of her girlfriends was "the snake" offering worldly knowledge; she was his "little Eva" going along with his games. Yet there's no restraining the venom when it comes to an overly prim junior high English teacher who had the nerve to try to comfort her when she was mad about getting a B: "I knew I'd get her someday and this is it: eat shit, bitch." Her college years yielded a few political insurrection anecdotes, followed by some European travel stories, but the narrative segues increasingly into discussions of rape and other forms of violence against women. Jail's too good for most rapists and batterers; she'd have their victims shoot them dead. When "pedophile" Allen Ginsberg fretted about being sent to jail after the Supreme Court upheld the criminalization of child porn, she wished him dead, too. She ends with a long-winded lament of "the worst immoralit[ies]" mostly concerning selling out one's principles, giving up and pretending not to see injustices which all boil down to "a single sin of human nothingness and stupidity." "I don't care about being understood," Dworkin concludes, but not being understood may be the least ofher problems here. Agent, Elaine Markson. (Mar. 1)Forecast:This memoir covers little new ground, but at least it's much shorter than Dworkin's previous works. This and the book's timing (its publication coincides with Women's History Month) may entice readers.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>A Matter of Trust: (A Clean Epic Contemporary Second Chance Romance with a High Stakes Rescue in Glacier National Park) (Montana Rescue)</h2><p>Champion backcountry snowboarder Gage Watson has left the limelight behind after the death of one of his fans.

When Katie's husband, Chad, had been alive, one hour with Katie had been too much for Margo Bonner-and that hour had been used to make passive-aggressive digs at the woman who could never be good enough for her darling Chad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And now-now?-after Chad had been dead for nearly two years, Margo would be "passing through" and wanted to spend a couple of days with Katie? Why? And even stranger, why had Katie agreed to host the persnickety woman in her tiny one-bedroom apartment? She could've said no, could've made up an excuse, could've suddenly booked a one-way ticket to Bolivia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But she'd found herself saying, "Sure, that'll be fine."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Fine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Why in the world . . . ?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of Chad. Because I still miss him, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie sighed as she pushed away from her desk. She grabbed a peppermint from the jar before heading out of her office at Artisans Alley, her long skirt swishing as she walked. She, and the rest of the vendors, was dressed in nineteenth-century garb for the Dickens Festival, the Alley's second annual celebration of the holiday season. The other merchants on Victoria Square had also adopted the custom-and it was paying off in spades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Katie had taken over running the former applesauce warehouse now known as Artisans Alley-Chad's pet project-it had grown from being an unorganized, failing group of artisans to a profitable configuration of artists and vendors. Maybe that was another reason Katie hadn't refused Margo's offer. She wanted her former mother-in-law to see what she'd done with her son's legacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Katie, Vance just called," Rose Nash said, the spryest seventy-something-year-old Katie had ever met. Today, she was manning cash desk one, a cute bonnet covering her blonde curls, her blue eyes sparkling with pleasure. "His church's choir will be here to sing on Saturday from one until four. Oh, I can't wait to hear those heavenly voices filling the Alley with song."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie smiled. The customers loved it, too. "That's great. I was just going over to the tea shop for a minute. May I bring you back anything?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, no, thanks. It's . . . um . . ." Rose scrunched up her softly wrinkled face. "I've heard complaints about the food, and they don't seem to be doing much business lately."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Rose had a point. 'Twas the season, and all the other businesses in Victoria Square were bustling. From what Katie could see as she walked across the parking lot, there wasn't a single customer inside the tea shop. Something was definitely going on there. Two months ago, the tea shop seemed to have been thriving. Now, when it should have been at its busiest, the place was as dead as Jacob Marley.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although the bell over the door tinkled merrily when Katie walked into the shop, no one came out to greet her right away. It gave her the opportunity to consider the display case. There were some blueberry scones, but they looked slightly burned around the edges. Some miniature chicken salad croissants looked okay, but she wondered how long they'd been sitting there.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Francine Barnett finally emerged from the back of the shop, sliding her palms down the front of her soiled white apron. "Hi, Katie. How are you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm fine, thanks. Will you be open late for the lighting of the big Christmas tree on the Square on Saturday night?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't think so." Francine looked as though she'd been through the wringer. Her light brown eyes were red rimmed, as though she'd been crying, and black circles were evident on her pale skin.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is anything wrong?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She sighed. "It's that obvious, huh?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie chose her words carefully. "Probably not to anyone but me. You always seem lively and upbeat, but today . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Today I look like I've been crying my eyes out? That's because I have, dear. When we bought this place, Vonne swore to me that she'd help me run Afternoon Tea-that together we'd make it a grand success. And we did for a few months. Then Vonne got bored with it. It's too much for me to handle by myself, Katie."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She began to cry, and Katie hurried around the counter to put an arm around her and lead her to one of the tables. She pulled out a chair and eased her into it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Everything will be all right," Katie said. "May I get you some tea?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Francine laughed through her tears. "See? You're better at this than I am. Why don't you buy the shop? I'm sure you could make a success of it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't be ridiculous. You're just upset."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm not," she said. "I've actually been considering putting the tea shop up for sale now for weeks. I remember your telling me one time that you'd once considered running a bed-and-breakfast. Wouldn't a tea shop be the next-best thing?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie had wanted to serve afternoon tea at her B and B, the English Ivy Inn. But she'd been rudely awakened from that pipe dream when Chad invested nearly all their money into Artisans Alley and then died in a car accident, leaving her to make the best of "their" investment. She looked around the shop. There were so many things she could do to spruce up the place: fresh paint in a light pink with burgundy trim . . . delicate floral curtains . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Katie!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She snapped out of her reverie and apologized to Francine. "You caught me woolgathering."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I caught you considering the possibilities."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie inclined her head. "You did. But I'm not sure buying a tea shop is a viable option for me right now."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Of course it is! Look how you've turned around Artisans Alley in such a short amount of time. You'd have no problem here. You'd simply take over the lease, buy out our inventory and equipment-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Which might not be as easy as you make it sound," Katie said. "Getting a bank loan is no small feat."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know, but at least say you'll consider it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I . . . Have you talked with Vonne about this? Is she willing to give up the shop?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Francine scoffed. "I don't know where Vonne's head is these days, but she certainly isn't concerned with the day-to-day running of this shop. I'm the one who put up the capital to open this place, and I'm the one who's going to sell it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thought gave Katie pause. Could she make a go of the tea shop? What would the vendors at Artisans Alley say? Would they think she was abandoning them?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The bells over the door signaled a new arrival.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Francine dabbed at her eyes with a napkin. "Thank you for listening, Katie. Let me greet this customer, and I'll get you your tea."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie recognized the man: Detective Schuler of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. He strode over to meet Francine with his thumbs tucked into his belt, and appeared to be ever so full of self-importance. Sure, it was great that he'd been promoted from deputy, but that promotion had come only because Ray Davenport had retired from the force.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry, Ms. Barnett, but this is not a social call," he said, jerking his head in the direction of the tables. "I think you should sit down for this."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, that soothed Francine's nerves as well as you might imagine it would.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What is it? What's wrong?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is there somewhere we can speak privately?" Detective Schuler asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Say whatever you came to say in front of Katie. It's not like all of Victoria Square won't hear whatever it is by sundown anyway." She glanced at Katie. "I'm not saying you'd mention it, but gossip just seems to spread around this place like warm butter."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie nodded her understanding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"All right, then. Well . . . it's Vonne."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I figured as much." Francine shook her head. "What now? Reckless driving? Another DUI? Can I even bail her out of trouble this time?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Um . . . actually . . ." Detective Schuler's bravado seemed to have left him. "Well . . . there was an accident. I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but Vonne is dead."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie was shaken as she left Afternoon Tea . . . so shaken, in fact, that she ran headlong into Ray Davenport.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Whoa, there!" He'd dropped the bag he was carrying in order to grasp Katie's shoulders to steady her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To her dismay, Katie saw that the cinnamon bun he'd been carrying had fallen onto the pavement. She picked it up. "I'm sorry, Ray."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ray had retired as a homicide detective in the Sheriff's Office some five months before, and he was now operating Wood U, a gift shop featuring wood products, on Victoria Square. When Ray and Katie first met, they'd had the antagonistic relationship of investigator and murder suspect, but they'd eventually become friends. Now the stocky man was looking down at her with concern, his bushy brows drawn together like a chubby caterpillar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Are you all right?" he asked. "You're pale as a ghost."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let's talk while we walk." She held up the destroyed, sticky cinnamon bun. "I'll get you a replacement."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's not necessary." He seemed to realize that his hands were still resting on Katie's shoulders, and he removed them, took a step back, and retrieved the cinnamon bun. He dropped it into the bag and then in the nearest trash can. "I probably didn't need it anyway."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I beg to differ. And, as a matter of fact, I need one, too. Come on."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ray fell into step beside her. "So, are you going to tell me what has you so addled?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I dropped into the tea shop for a snack because, well . . . I was supposed to meet Andy for lunch, but he got busy . . . and then I got busy . . . and then-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Spit it out already."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Vonne Barnett is dead."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie explained that Detective Schuler had come into the tea shop just moments ago to inform Francine of Vonne's death. "Naturally, she closed the shop, and Schuler took her to Rochester and the morgue to make a positive identification."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ray shook his head. "What a shame. I was afraid her reckless driving would catch up with her one day. Some people never learn."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So Vonne had a bad driving record?" She recalled Francine's comments about DUI and reckless driving to the detective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"When I was on the force, I seem to recall she was about one citation away from losing her license for good."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By then, they'd reached Angelo's Pizzeria. Going to a pizzeria for a cinnamon bun might sound odd, but Andy Rust-who also happened to be Katie's boyfriend and landlord-made the best cinnamon buns around. In fact, he was known on Victoria Square as the Cinnamon Bun King.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ray opened the door for Katie and then followed her into the pizzeria.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Andy's blue T-shirt emphasized his muscular torso, and his eyes lit up as he stepped out from around the counter and gave Katie a peck on the lips. "What brings you by?" He gave Ray a quizzical look. "And did you eat that cinnamon bun already?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, he didn't. I wasn't watching where I was going, and I knocked it out of his hands," Katie said. "So, I'd like two to go please."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Coming right up." Andy got them the cinnamon buns, and Katie paid for them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have to get back to work," he said, "but I'm looking forward to seeing you tonight." He gave Katie another quick kiss, glanced at Ray, and then went into the back room.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Out on the asphalt apron outside the shop, Ray assured Katie again that replacing his cinnamon bun hadn't been necessary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It certainly was," she said. "Would you care to eat with me in my office? Or we can go back to your shop, if you'd rather. I'd just like to talk with you for a minute."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let's go to Artisans Alley. Your coffee is better than mine."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie was relieved that Rose wasn't at her post when she and Ray strode into the Alley's main showroom and down the aisle to the vendors' lounge. Rose must have taken a break to check her booth. Katie got the coffee quickly, so she'd be safely back in her office before Rose noticed her return. She didn't feel like explaining to Rose-or any of the other Artisans Alley vendors or patrons-why there had been a sheriff's cruiser at Afternoon Tea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie doctored the cups of coffee: milk for both and two sugars for Ray. He liked his coffee sweet. She slipped into the cramped office where Ray sat on the chair near her desk. He'd spread paper towels out for their cinnamon buns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What did you want to talk about? Is it Vonne?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie shook her head. "No. I don't want any news of Vonne's accident coming from me. Francine made it clear that she doesn't like the fact that news spreads so quickly in the Square."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He shrugged. "That's small-town life."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I wanted to talk with you about your in-laws."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His bushy brows shot up. "I must admit, I wasn't expecting that. What do you want to know?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Did your relationship with them change after Rachel died?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No. Her parents have always been supportive and involved in the girls' lives, and Rachel's death did nothing to diminish that. If anything, it made their bond with them stronger."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course. Ray had three teenage daughters. His situation was much different than hers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a pause, he said, "I can't help you if you won't talk to me, Katie."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She smiled slightly. "It's Chad's mom . . . Margo. She and I never got along, but she called me this morning, said she was going to be in the area and wants to spend a couple of days with me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ray's lips twitched. "You and a woman you don't like in a teensy apartment. I'm trying to decide whether or not I'd like to be a fly on the wall for that."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Katie scoffed. "Trust me, you would not. Why? Why, after all this time, would she want to visit me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're her last tie to her son."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tears pricked the backs of her eyes, and Katie quickly blinked them away. But, then, not much got past Ray.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't mean to make you feel worse."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You didn't. I simply hadn't looked at it from her point of view."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He patted her hand. "Give the woman a chance. She's reaching out to you for a reason. You owe it to yourself-and to her and even Chad-to spend some time with her."</p></p><h2>Home for the Summer: The Chesapeake Diaries</h2><p><b><i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mariah Stewart presents a captivating contemporary romance novel in the tradition of Robyn Carr, Susan Mallery, and Barbara Freethy.</b><br><br>Some of Lucy Sinclair&#x2019;s best days were those spent growing up in small town St. Dennis&#x2014;working at the family inn and enjoying summers filled with swimming, sailing, tennis, and the company of Clay Madison, her best friend.

There had been something exciting and so grown-�up about folding her clothes and tucking them inside the plaid fabric travel bag next to her sneakers and sandals and the plastic cosmetic case she borrowed from her mother for her toothpaste, toothbrush, dental floss, and shampoo. She&#x2019;d also packed a diary&#x2014;�in which she planned to write every day&#x2014;�and a pen with which she could record the anticipated noteworthy moments as well as write postcards home.<br><br>She&#x2019;d returned from those two August weeks at her aunt and uncle&#x2019;s Pennsylvania farm without having opened the diary and all but three of her postcards were still secured in the rubber band. As instructed, she&#x2019;d sent one to her parents at the end of the first week (&#x201c;Aunt Clarissa and Lydia were both stung by yellow jackets yesterday and we spent the whole afternoon in the emergency room. Jake got poison ivy from playing in the weeds. I don&#x2019;t think I have it yet. Love, Lucy&#x201d;). The other two went to her younger brother, Ford, who at eight was deemed too young to go away by himself (&#x201c;Uncle Pat says you can come when you&#x2019;re ten, which is totally unfair because I had to wait until I was twelve&#x201d;), and to her best friend, Clay Madison (&#x201c;I went fishing in the lake and caught three bass in one day! We found a cool old cemetery that has graves from the Revolutionary War! I took lots of pictures&#x2014;�can&#x2019;t wait to show you!&#x201d;).<br><br>Now, at thirty-�five, packing had become so routine she could do it with her eyes closed, and these days, her trips rarely promised such adventure. The old plaid suitcase had been banished years ago to the attic, and, knowing her mother, was probably still tucked up under the eaves, and she couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time she&#x2019;d gone fishing. The one thing that hadn&#x2019;t changed was the look on her mother&#x2019;s face when Lucy entered the lobby of the Inn at Sinclair Point, suitcase in tow and her computer bag over her shoulder, and announced that she was ready to leave for the airport.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have everything?&#x201d; Grace Sinclair asked her daughter.<br><br>Lucy opened her handbag and checked for her plane ticket, her sunglasses, and the keys to her rental car. &#x201c;Got it all. And if by chance I did forget something, you can always send it out or hold on to it until I come back next month to meet with Robert Magellan.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m still having a hard time convincing myself that&#x2019;s really going to happen.&#x201d; Lucy shook her head as if still in disbelief that one of the wealthiest men in the country wanted to talk to her about planning his wedding. &#x201c;Thanks for arranging it, Mom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank Trula. She&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;s insisting that Robert not even consider another event planner,&#x201d; Grace reminded her. &#x201c;Or another venue.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I did thank her.&#x201d; Lucy slid her sunglasses to the top of her head. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d get to thank her again this morning, but she doesn&#x2019;t seem to be up yet.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad she&#x2019;s sleeping in.&#x201d; Grace lifted Lucy&#x2019;s computer bag. &#x201c;She never gets a chance to&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Baloney. I&#x2019;ve been up for hours.&#x201d; Trula Comfort, Grace&#x2019;s best friend for just about as long as either could remember, marched down the steps and joined them near the information desk. &#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d be gracious and allow you two to have a nice breakfast together without me hanging around.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trula, you can hang around as much as you want.&#x201d; Lucy hugged the older woman. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy you were here this weekend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was glad to be here. Thought it would be good to see your work product before I browbeat Robert and Susanna into having their wedding here, with you at the helm.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha.&#x201d; Grace grinned. &#x201c;You just admitted to browbeating.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One does what one must when one must.&#x201d; Trula gave Lucy one last hug, then looked around for something to carry.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take that.&#x201d; Daniel, Lucy&#x2019;s brother and the inn&#x2019;s proprietor, grabbed the handle of Lucy&#x2019;s suitcase just as Trula was about to. &#x201c;You weren&#x2019;t planning on sneaking out on me without saying good-�bye, were you?&#x201d; He put a hand on his sister&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>&#x201c;Have I ever?&#x201d; Lucy asked as she fished in her bag for the keys she&#x2019;d had just a moment ago but dropped when she hugged Trula. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just trying to get organized. It appears I need a committee to get on my way.&#x201d;<br><br>Daniel wheeled the suitcase toward the inn&#x2019;s double doors and held one side open for the trio who trailed behind him.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, Danny.&#x201d; Lucy smiled as she stepped outside into a crisp early winter morning. &#x201c;Brrr. I keep forgetting how chilly it gets here in December. Remind me to bring a coat back with me next time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Any chance next time might be Christmas?&#x201d; her mother asked. Lucy could tell that Grace was trying her best not to appear too hopeful.<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t look like it, Mom.&#x201d; Lucy paused at the car and opened the doors and trunk with the remote. &#x201c;We have so many parties lined up, and several weddings, including two on Christmas Eve and another on Christmas night. Bonnie had two big events this past weekend that she had to handle on her own, and I think her last nerve is just about gone. I can&#x2019;t take off again in two weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I doubt either of those shindigs was as &#x2018;big&#x2019; as the wedding of Dallas MacGregor.&#x201d; Grace handed over the computer.<br><br>&#x201c;That wedding was big even for us, and we&#x2019;ve handled some big affairs over the years.&#x201d; Lucy put her bag on the front seat and turned to hug her mother. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t even know how to thank you for helping me to land that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All I did was set the wheels in motion, dear.&#x201d; Grace held on to her daughter for a long moment before patting her on the back and releasing her. &#x201c;The &#x2018;landing&#x2019; was all your doing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s right, Luce.&#x201d; Daniel placed her suitcase in the trunk. &#x201c;The inn never would have gotten the MacGregor wedding without you.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Sorry. The MacGregor weddings. We can&#x2019;t forget that Dallas&#x2019;s brother got married on Saturday, too. I&#x2019;ve been running the inn for a long time and I&#x2019;ve seen a lot of really spectacular weddings here, but nothing like Saturday&#x2019;s affair.&#x201d; He slammed the trunk. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a long time before people stop talking about it. And since all those stories and photographs started flooding the Internet on Sunday, our phone has been ringing off the hook and we can&#x2019;t keep up with the emails.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Great. It&#x2019;s about time the inn was recognized as the destination venue on the Eastern Shore.&#x201d; Lucy reached out for her brother. &#x201c;You run one hell of a business, bro.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We do our best.&#x201d; Daniel planted a kiss on the top of his sister&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;But we never could have pulled off what you did this weekend. Madeline is a good event planner, but she doesn&#x2019;t have your skill and creativity or your experience. We wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten this job if you hadn&#x2019;t agreed to come back and handle the planning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, remember that I&#x2019;ve been doing this for thirteen years now. I&#x2019;ve made a lot of contacts.&#x201d; She jangled her keys softly in her hands, a nervous habit. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all in the contacts, Danny-�boy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I appreciate that you dug in and pulled it off with so little time. I know it was stressful,&#x201d; he told her.<br><br>&#x201c;It was so worth it, are you kidding me? Bonnie says our phones have been ringing nonstop since yesterday, too. What a plum for the r�sum�.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And perhaps an even larger plum awaits,&#x201d; Trula said.<br><br>&#x201c;From your lips, Trula.&#x201d; Lucy kissed the older woman, then kissed her mother, and pretended not to see the touch of sadness in Grace&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be talking to you, Mom. And I&#x2019;ll be back soon enough. Maybe we could have our Christmas in January this year.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fine idea. We&#x2019;ll leave the tree up.&#x201d; Grace nodded and stepped back from the car. &#x201c;Safe trip, love.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;With any luck, I&#x2019;ll be sleeping the whole time.&#x201d; Lucy angled behind the wheel and her brother closed the door for her. &#x201c;Take care, everyone.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bye, Lucy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks again . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Lucy turned the key in the ignition and headed around the circular drive to the long lane that led from the inn to the main road, trying to swallow the lump in her throat. For her, coming home was both agony and ecstasy. She loved her family more than anything, cherished the time she spent with her mother and brothers&#x2014;�but staying at the inn brought back her most painful memory. The irony was not lost on her that her childhood home, the place where she&#x2019;d been raised with so much love and laughter, also housed her worst nightmares. The place where she should have felt most secure was where she had been most vulnerable.<br><br>She blinked back tears, knowing that her long absences hurt her mother, and yet she could never explain why she stayed away, why even this time around she&#x2019;d slept more nights at the home of one of the brides, Steffie Wyler, than she had at the inn. Grace would all but die if she knew the truth, if Lucy were to tell her why she was more comfortable sleeping under another roof&#x2014;�any roof&#x2014;�than the inn&#x2019;s. Keeping her secret was Lucy&#x2019;s way of shielding her mother from an even greater pain, and so she&#x2019;d moved to the opposite side of the country and came home only for those family events she could not avoid.<br><br>Turning her back on the inn with a conflicting sense of both relief and regret, Lucy negotiated the first broad curve in the road just as a dark Jeep rounded the bend at the same time. Pulling as far to the right as she could, Lucy slowed to pass the oncoming car on the narrow drive.<br><br>Daniel should have this widened, she was thinking, when she realized the driver of the Jeep had stopped next to her. She stared at the driver through her dark glasses against the glare of the morning sun, then reluctantly hit the brake and rolled down her window.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you weren&#x2019;t going to leave town without saying good-�bye.&#x201d; Clay Madison had rolled down his driver&#x2019;s-�side window as well.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry. I have an afternoon flight out of Baltimore and am running a little late.&#x201d; Lucy cleared her throat. &#x201c;Besides, I thought we said good-�bye after the wedding on Saturday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought we&#x2019;d only said good night.&#x201d; He paused, then added, &#x201c;I was hoping for a chance to sit and talk, you know. Catch up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We did that on Saturday,&#x201d; she replied, suddenly aware that she&#x2019;d sounded somewhat prim, and wished she hadn&#x2019;t.<br><br>&#x201c;We only touched the surface, LuLu.&#x201d; He took off his sunglasses and held them in the hand that hung out the window. His eyes were an odd mix of blue and gray, and they studied her face with what she&#x2019;d first thought might be amusement, but now wasn&#x2019;t quite sure. Looking into them, Lucy felt a spark of guilt. Over the weekend, she&#x2019;d had an opportunity to say things to him that needed to be said, and she had let it slip away.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe next time,&#x201d; she told him, hoping she&#x2019;d have found the nerve by then, but suspecting that she might not.<br><br>&#x201c;When&#x2019;s that going to be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I might be back in January to talk to . . . to a potential client.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I heard Robert Magellan was interested in booking the inn for his wedding this summer but only if you&#x2019;d do your wedding planning thing.&#x201d;<br><br>Lucy frowned. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you hear that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Trula mentioned it last week when she stopped in with your mom for coffee at Cuppachino.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no such thing as discretion in this town,&#x201d; she grumbled, and he laughed, the sound touching something inside her, the way his laughter always had. &#x201c;I need to go if I&#x2019;m going to make my plane.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is where you&#x2019;re supposed to say, &#x2018;It was great seeing you, Clay.&#x2019; &#x201d; He slid his glasses back onto his face.<br><br>&#x201c;It was great seeing you again.&#x201d; Lucy nodded. It had been great.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, LuLu. You, too. See you next time around.&#x201d; He rolled up his window and continued on the drive toward the inn.<br><br>&#x201c;You need to stop calling me &#x2018;LuLu,&#x2019; &#x201d; she muttered, though he was gone.<br><br>It took a moment for her to realize that her foot was still on the brake. She hit the accelerator and followed the lane to Charles Street, where she made a left, trying not to think about Clay and the fact that when he wanted to get her attention, he still called her by the name he&#x2019;d given her when they were in kindergarten, for crying out loud. No one, but NO ONE, had ever been permitted to call her that, except Clay, her onetime best friend.<br><br>All weekend long, the guilt from knowing that she still owed him, if not an apology, certainly an explanation for something she&#x2019;d done long ago, hung between them. He&#x2019;d not asked, and she&#x2019;d not offered, but it was there nonetheless. It rankled that even now, so many years later, she was unable to bring it up and out into the open. Perhaps if she could, she&#x2019;d be done with it, once and for all, and the nightmares would stop. Maybe then she could come home and sleep in her old room and not wake up in the middle of the night, cold with sweat and shaking with fear. Maybe just telling someone after all these years would make a difference . . .<br><br>She was mulling that thought over as she drove through the center of town and past the shops that had helped to rejuvenate this small bayside community when renewal had been needed most. For several hundred years, the town had quietly grown on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay, the crab and oyster industries supporting the residents for generations. But time, overfishing, and polluted waters had taken their toll on the famed Chesapeake Blue crabs and the Bay&#x2019;s oysters alike, and the local watermen had to turn to other means to make their living. As their businesses began to die, so did the town. Soon an exodus began, as more and more families moved away in search of a life that could sustain them. For years, it was said that Charles Street only led out of town.<br><br>And now new businesses were thriving: Bling, for upscale women&#x2019;s clothing and accessories; Cuppa- chino, for the best coffee on the Eastern Shore and darned good light lunches; the Checkered Cloth for tasty takeout; Let&#x2019;s Do Brunch, for quick breakfasts through elegant brunches; One Scoop or Two, for incredible homemade ice cream; and Bow Wows and Meows, the pricey shop for pampered pets (after all the years she&#x2019;d spent in L.A., dogs wearing sundresses and pearls no longer gave Lucy pause) which, rumor had it, was being turned over to the present owner&#x2019;s daughter&#x2014;�Clay&#x2019;s sister, Brooke&#x2014;�who was converting the shop into a bakery to be called Cupcake, which would sell only, well, cupcakes.<br><br>Charles Street represented an all-�new St. Dennis to Lucy, and she was just fine with that. When she was growing up, many of those same shops were single-�family homes, and others were boarded-�up storefronts. There&#x2019;d been fewer businesses and hardly any tourists, though the inn had always been packed in the summer, and of course, the crabbing and oyster fishing had had some good years along with some not so good. The St. Dennis Gazette&#x2014;�owned and operated for over a century by her mother&#x2019;s family&#x2014;�was still the only local newspaper, but the inn was no longer the only place in town to book a room. Now, Lucy mused, it seemed like every other house that had been built before 1900 had been turned into a bed-�and-�breakfast.<br><br>But it was all good, she reminded herself, because it meant that her hometown was alive and growing. St. Dennis had always had charm, even when it had been little more than a tiny watermen&#x2019;s village on the Bay. Houses that back then had been plagued by peeling paint and sagging porches were now the stars on the annual Christmas Tour. While in some parts of town the rejuvenation was still a work in progress, efforts had been made to offer something that would bring the tourists&#x2014;�and their dollars&#x2014;�coming back twelve months of the year. Certainly her family had benefited&#x2014;�the inn was slowly becomi...</p><h2>Fairacre Festival</h2><p>Tthe first day of October brings an unheralded and violent storm, which whips through Fairacre, blowing down trees and telephone poles -- and, worst of all, damaging the roof of St. Patrick&#x2019;s Church. The inhabitants of tiny Fairacre can&#x2019;t imagine how they will be able to afford the repairs, until Mr. Willett suggests a fundraising festival. Preparations for a food sale, a concert, a school play, and a gigantic Christmas bazaar are soon made -- but will they be enough?

His early death is a staggering loss for our poetry, but what he left is a major achievement that will enrich our lives.&#x201d;&nbsp; Each of his books was published to wide critical acclaim, and David St. John has collected together the best of his work from his first five books: <i>Wrecking Crew</i> (1972), <i>Afterlife</i> (1976), <i>The Dollmaker&#x2019;s Ghost </i>(1981), <i>Winter Stars</i> (1985) and <i>The Widening Spell of the Leaves</i> (1991). <br><br>&#x201c;It is not an exaggeration to say that the death of Larry Levis in 1996&#x2014;of a heart attack at 49&#x2014;sent a shock wave through the ranks of American poetry. Not only was Levis a good friend to many poets (not simply of his own generation but of many poets older and younger as well), his poetry had become a kind of touchstone for many of us, a source of special inspiration and awe. With Larry Levis&#x2019; death came the sense that an American original had been lost. . . . It is not at all paradoxical that he saw both the most intimate expressions of poetry and the grandest gestures of art, of language, as constituting individual acts of courage. One can only hope that, like such courage, Larry Levis&#x2019;s remarkable poems will continue to live far into our literature.&#x201d;&#x2014;from the Afterword, by David St. John<br><br></p><p>Larry Levis was born in Fresno, California, in 1946. His first book of poems, <i>Wrecking Crew</i>, won the United States Award from the International Poetry Forum, and was published in the Pitt Poetry Series in 1972. His second book, <i>The Afterlife</i>, won the Lamont Award from the American Academy of Poets in 1976. In 1981, <i>The Dollmaker's Ghost</i> was a winner of the Open Competition of the National Poetry Series. Among his other awards were three fellowships in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts, a Fulbright Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Larry Levis died in 1996. <br>&#x201c;If I could select one book of poetry from the past year to read and read again, this is it. If I could teach only one poet to younger poets, it would be Larry Levis. . . . If I could describe everything poets want their poets to do, regardless of their style and intentions, I would turn to Levis' poetry once again, and not say a word." <br><i>--Bloomsbury Review</i><br><br>"As his command of the poetic line widened, Levis's poetry became almost literally breathtaking, a kind of verse that spelled itself out and cast it's spell in such sinewy inventive cadences that the leaves to which he referred in 'the widening spell of the leaves' might well have been those most powerfully American bits of foliage, Leaves of Grass." <br><i>--Poetry</i></p><h2>Love Unexpected: A Great Lakes Lighthouse Marriage of Convenience Historical Romance (Beacons of Hope)</h2><p><b>1859<br>Presque Isle, Michigan<br><br></b><b><i>What Is the Secret That Could Shipwreck Both of Their Lives?<br></i></b><br>All Emma Chambers ever wanted was a home, but when her steamboat sinks just outside Presque Isle, she's left destitute and with no place to stay.<br><br>An unlikely solution arises when the lighthouse keeper arrives in town.

The original illustrations, by Charles Robinson, are perfect visual companions to the rich and illuminating text.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite Manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too.<p></p><p>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin, Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>Dancing Arabs</h2><p>A bild�ngsroman suffused with humor and irony, Dancing Arabs centers on a young boy from a poor Arab village, his haphazard receipt of a scholarship to a Jewish boarding school, and the dislocation and alienation that ensues when he finds himself faced with the impossible: the imperative to straddle two famously incompatible worlds.<br><br>As a child, our nameless narrator/antihero lives with his family in his grandmother's house. His grandmother and father constantly impress upon him the significance of their land: when so many people fled or sold theirs away, they held strong. "Better to die fighting for your land than to give it away."<br>Every night after his brothers fall asleep, he climbs into bed with his grandmother, his main source of comfort and protection. One night she tells him where the key to her secret cupboard are, and if she should die, he must find all the death equipment in the blue bag. Paranoid from then on, he races home every day at recess to see if she's died. One day he gets there and she is not there, so he unlocks the cupboard and pulls out the box. All he finds are towels and some soaps from Mecca, but then he notices his father's photo in the old newspaper lining the suitcase, and some postcards in his father's handwriting. At his urging, his grandmother tells him about the newspaper clippings: his father was always "the handsomest and the smartest" in Tira, until he was thrown in jail for his political activity (eg: bombing a school cafeteria). The grandmother visited her son every week, wrote letters to the mayor, anyone who might be able to help her son. When he was released years later, he remained politically active, revering the Egyptian president Nasser, and for a time, joined the communist party.<br><br>The young narrator is nothing like his father, who "doesn't understand how my brothers and I came out the way we did. We can't even draw a flag. He says kids smaller than us walk through the streets singing 'P-L-O----Israel NO!' and he shouts at us for not even knowing what PLO stands for." Not at all politically motivated, the boy knows nothing of national identity; he simply wants to get through the school day without getting smacked by his teacher.<br><br>He excels at school and his family dreams that by the time he graduates, they will have their own state and he will become a pilot, or a judge. One day the principal tells him the Jews are opening a school for gifted students and they will be admitting a few Arab kids too. He is accepted and his father whoops with joy-this will mean a better life for his son and his whole family.<br><br>His transition at school is very rough. The other students make fun of how he speaks and eats. On a bus home to Tira during his first school break, he is singled out and pulled off the bus by some soldiers. Humiliated, he proceeds on his journey home, but gets off of two more buses fearing that he will be questioned again. He winds up at Ben Gurion airport where his father has to come get him. He cries the whole way home and says he is never going back. His father mocks his tears and his weakness and tells him he has no choice-this is his only chance to escape the limitations of life in Tira. (The tug of war between father and son continues throughout the novel, the father putting his hopes and aspirations onto his son, as well as his defeats and disappointments.)<br><br>He goes back to school, but only after deciding that he will never be identified as an Arab again. He becomes an expert at assuming false identities: he shaves off his moustache, learns how to pronounce Hebrew like the Jews, buys new clothes, starts listening to only Hebrew music. Soon he falls in love with Naomi, one of his Jewish classmates. On Memorial Day for the Fallen Soldiers, the narrator does not stand up during the moment of silence, and Naomi, whose father had died in action, refuses to speak to him. Eventually, Naomi admits that she loves him too, and for a while, they are together in spite of their differences. She initiates him into a new world of movie theatres and restaurants, and for the first time he learns that Zionism is an ideology, not a swear word; that his aunt is called a refugee; that Arabs in Israel are called a minority; he learns the meaning of both national homeland, and anti-semitism.<br><br>As the end of his final term draws near, he is constantly tired and dizzy, cannot sleep or eat. He knows that he and Naomi will have to break up when school ends. He takes a bottle of pills the night before a big exam, and winds up in the hospital. His father comes and blames it on "that Jewish whore." After a short convalescence, he finds himself at Hebrew University. He trails Naomi at school, but she avoids him. He stops going to class-he uses his unlimited bus pass to travel the streets of Jerusalem for hours listening to his walkman. This is how he meets Samia, an Arab student who asks him the way to Hadassah hospital one day; he takes her there himself and they areeeeee a couple from then on. Four years later he decides it is time for them to marry. He and his wife are both Israeli citizens and know Hebrew well, but the narrator, a lost son, has no place to go back to after having been exposed to the tempting Israeli experience from which he is barred. He and his wife move to Beit Tsefafa, an Arab neighborhood where they don't know anyone. Soon the second intifada begins to rage-the narrator refers to it as "the war." He begins drinking heavily. He blames his father for his optimism, his faith that it will all turn out well for them, that his going to the boarding school would make a difference.<br><br>His aimlessness and self-loathing deepen and spiral: he grows apart from his wife, he drinks, fantasizes about taking a lover, and is preoccupied with all his failures. Through his self-destructive haze, he decides he will make everything right-he and his wife will sleep together peacefully, like spoons, he'll give up drinking, he'll start praying, he'll become politically active, a member of the Knesset. He even makes a pilgrimage to Mecca with his one Arab friend from boarding school. But the biggest revelation he has there is that there is no beer in all of Saudi Arabia.<br><br>One night the narrator is at a bar watching Arabs take over the dance floor. He is disgusted by their ugliness, their lack of grace and self-consciousness. He affirms that Arabs should not be allowed dance, not only because they look ridiculous, but because they make him, the narrator look ridiculous. On Land Day in March, his wife goes with her family to their old village, which is now a Jewish neighborhood. They dress up and bring a picnic as they do on every Land Day and Independence Day. His father criticizes her family, these "refugees"-if they really loved their land, why did they leave it in the first place?<br>After a trip to Egypt, his father gives up on his dreams of liberation and statehood. He was stopped at a border crossing for hours and something in him broke. Now he doesn't want to fight any more. He hates Arabs: "It is better to be the slave of your enemy than to be the slave of a leader from within your own people."<br><br>In the final scene, the narrator and his wife and baby are sleeping on a mattress in his grandmother's room and his grandmother gets up in the middle of the night and vomits. He gets up to take care of her and she tells him it's like this every night, but that it's not death that makes her cry, it's that she used to think she'd be buried in her own land and now she knows that will never happen. The narrator and his grandmother sit and they both cry together. Filled with humorous observations, this is ultimately a serious book in which huge human truths are delivered in the most deadpan tone, and in which the individual self is lost to the strangling demands of family, history, and political realities.<br></p><p>No Bio<br><br>No Bio<br><br>No BioKashua resists stereotype in this slyly subversive, semi-autobiographical account of Arab Israeli life, telling the story of a Palestinian boy who wins a prestigious scholarship to a Jewish high school, but slips into listless malaise as an adult, despising himself, scorning his fellow Arabs and resenting the Israelis. The unnamed narrator spends his childhood in the village of Tira. His grandfather was killed in the 1948 war, and his father was jailed for two years before he was married, accused of blowing up a university cafeteria. The narrator doesn't inherit his father's revolutionary tendencies; he's even ignorant of his own history ("In twelfth grade I understood for the first time what '48 was.... Suddenly I understood that Zionism is an ideology. In civics lessons and Jewish history classes, I started to understand that my aunt from Tulkarm is called a refugee, that the Arabs in Israel are called a minority"). When he goes away to the Jewish boarding school, his greatest desire is to fit in, and he bursts into tears the first time he is stopped at a checkpoint. He never finishes college, taking low-level jobs at an institution for the retarded and a bar. When he finally drifts into marriage to an Arab nursing student, he cringes at her dark skin and soon dreams about taking a lover. He can't even find solace in belief, though he fantasizes about becoming a respected teacher of religion. The drab hopelessness of his life is offset by his self-awareness ("I'm a failure anyway") and by Kashua's deadpan, understated humor. Nearly absurdist at moments, this is a chilling, convincing tale. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Author Wendy Palmer shows readers through basic practice and partner exercises how to become more aware of the body and trust its innate wisdom. She introduces exercises from the Conscious Embodiment and Intuition Training program she pioneered, connection movement, meditation, and breathing. These exercises form a daily practice that can help the process of integration, of deepening and unifying the self, and learning to deal with fear and anger. Written in a direct yet nurturing style and based on the author&#x2019;s many years of practice and teaching, this revised edition of <i>The Intuitive Body </i>contains new material on Conscious Embodiment movement and meditation practices. Also here are new chapters on advocating without aggressing and the wisdom of not knowing &#x2014; embodying the qualities of dignity and integrity in everyday life. The book is ideal for readers who are already engaged in the process of becoming, as well as for those who are looking for ways to find the courage to begin.</p><p>Wendy Palmer developed Conscious Embodiment over 25 years ago. A sixth-degree black belt in aikido and chief instructor at Aikido of Tamalpais in Sausalito, CA, she is also the author of the <i>Intuitive Body </i>DVD. She lives in Marin, CA.<b>From the Introduction: How This Book Works<br><br></b>In this book I am presenting my approach to rediscovering the part of ourselves that is wise, kind, and capable of clear and powerful embodied action. This way of being arises out of what I call the &#x201c;intuitive state,&#x201d; a spontaneous, intelligent, and creative aspect of ourselves which has not been distorted by our fear and confusion.<br><br>Intuition usually arises in a nonlinear fashion. In our Western culture, the habit of sequential thought has been given a superior role in respect to the way life is viewed. In my opinion, based on living in this culture and experiencing the result of this priority, it does not work. It has not made us happy. There are millions of years of evolution in our cells. A deep store of wisdom lies within and we must look within to access it. We can use our discomfort and dissatisfaction with life to investigate other possibilities or ways of living. We can invite our intuition, our wise knowing, to govern or lead our choices toward a full embrace of life.<br><br>The first part of this book deals with becoming grounded in our bodies. Without a firm root system or foundation, intuitive perceptions cannot be focused into embodied action. The second section discusses mental perception and working with the movement and power of our thoughts. This paves the way for us to find how to create a spacious environment from which the wisdom of our intuition can arise, as discussed in the third section. The fourth part addresses the nature of embodied action: <i>irimi, </i>entering fully into life situations, and how to work with our perceptions during the many activities and pressures of life. The practice guides at the end of the book are provided as outlines for quick reference to the techniques described in the previous sections.<br><br>It is my hope that you will feel free to take these ideas and make them your own by adjusting them to suit your inner needs. The techniques can be used as they are or changed and integrated into your already existing practice. Each of us is a unique individual. When we are sensitive to our own personal experiences, we lend compassion and support to ourselves by being creative. If we can live in a way that promotes a little more kindness and a little less greed, we will have served ourselves and our planet beautifully.</p><h2>Night Fall (Large Print)</h2><p><strong>A New York Times Bestselling Author</strong>&lt; P&gt;On a Long Island beach at dusk, Bob Mitchell and Janet Whitney conduct their illicit love affair in front of a video camera, set to record each steamy moment. Suddenly a terrible explosion lights up the sky. Grabbing the camera, the couple flees as approaching police cars speed toward the scene. Five years later, the crash of Flight 800 has been attributed to a mechanical malfunction. But for John Corey and Kate Mayfield, both members of the elite Anti-terrorist Task Force, the case is not closed. Suspecting a cover-up at the highest levels and disobeying orders, they set out to find the one piece of evidence that will prove the truth about what really happened to Flight 800 - the videotape that shows a couple making love on the beach and the last moments of the doomed airliner.</p><p>John Corey, former NYPD homicide detective, assigned to the Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force in the pre-millennium 90's, makes a return appearance in a thoughtful novel offering an alternative to the government's "official" position on what really happened to TWA Flight 800, which crashed off the Long Island coast in the summer of 1996. Accompanying his wife Kate to a memorial marking the five-year anniversary of the crash, Corey's curiosity is aroused by what appears to be a concerted effort by Kate's fellow federal agents to keep him--and her--from investigating a case that appears to be closed. Corey's detecting skills lead him to two witnesses to the crash, who were enjoying an adulterous interlude on the beach at the time the plane went down--and videotaping their sexual escapades while what appears to be a terrorist missile attack takes place in the background. What ratchets up the tension in this capably written thriller is what the reader knows but Corey doesn't as he heads for a showdown with those responsible for the official cover-up as the clock ticks down to the morning of September 11, 2001. DeMille's deft touch with a riddle wrapped in an enigma--what really happened to Flight 800--makes his "what if" scenario a more than plausible theory; you don't have to believe in conspiracies or government cover-ups to find his latest engrossing, entertaining, and enlightening. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p> </p><p></p><p> <strong>Amazon.com Exclusive Content</strong> </p><p> </p><p></p><p> <b>Nelson DeMille on <i>Night Fall</i>: An Exclusive Essay</b> <br></p><p> It was a true story, the explosion of TWA Flight 800 off the coast of Long Island in 1996, that inspired Nelson DeMille to write the fictional <i>Night Fall</i>.

In this charming series, Mma&nbsp; Ramotswe&#x2014;with help from her loyal associate, Grace Makutsi&#x2014;navigates her cases and her personal life with wisdom, good humor, and the occasional cup of tea.</b><br><br>The beloved first novel in The No. 1 Ladies&#x2019; Detective Agency series, now available for the first time in hardcover, tells the story of the delightfully cunning and enormously engaging Precious Ramotswe, who is drawn to her profession to &#x201c;help people with problems in their lives.&#x201d; Immediately upon setting up shop in a small storefront in Gaborone, Mma Ramotswe is hired to track down a missing husband, uncover a con man, and follow a wayward daughter. But the case that tugs at her heart&#x2013;and lands her in danger&#x2013;is that of a missing eleven-year-old boy who may have been snatched by witch doctors.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, July 2001:</b> Working in a mystery tradition that will cause genre aficionados to think of such classic sleuths as Melville Davisson Post's Uncle Abner or Robert van Gulik's Judge Dee, Alexander McCall Smith creates an African detective, Precious Ramotswe, who's their full-fledged heir. <p> It's the detective as folk hero, solving crimes through an innate, self-possessed wisdom that, combined with an understanding of human nature, invariably penetrates into the heart of a puzzle. If Miss Marple were fat and jolly and lived in Botswana--and decided to go against any conventional notion of what an unmarried woman should do, spending the money she got from selling her late father's cattle to set up a Ladies' Detective Agency--then you have an idea of how Precious sets herself up as her country's first female detective. Once the clients start showing up on her doorstep, Precious enjoys a pleasingly successful series of cases. </p> <p> But the edge of the Kalahari is not St. Mary Mead, and the sign Precious orders, painted in brilliant colors, is anything but discreet. Pointing in the direction of the small building she had purchased to house her new business, it reads "THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT." </p> <p> The solutions she comes up with, whether in the case of the clinic doctor with two quite different personalities (depending on the day of the week), or the man who had joined a Christian sect and seemingly vanished, or the kidnapped boy whose bones may or may not be those in a witch doctor's magic kit, are all sensible, logical, and satisfying. Smith's gently ironic tone is full of good humor towards his lively, intelligent heroine and towards her fellow Africans, who live their lives with dignity and with cautious acceptance of the confusions to which the world submits them. Precious Ramotswe is a remarkable creation, and <i>The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency</i> well deserves the praise it received from London's <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>.

The result was an autobiographical narrative, a tale of thirty-six years (1271-1306) in the life of Lady Nijo, starting when she became the concubine of a retired emperor in Kyoto at the age of fourteen and ending, several love affairs later, with an account of her new life as a wandering Buddhist nun. Through the vagaries of history, however, the glory of Lady Nijo's story has taken six and half centuries to arrive. <i>The Confessions of Lady Nijo</i> or <i>Towazugatari</i> in Japanese, was not widely circulated after it was written, perhaps because of the dynastic quarrel that soon split the imperial family, or perhaps because of Lady Nijo's intimate portrait of a very human emperor. Whatever the cause, the book was neglected, then forgotten completely, and only a single manuscript survived. This was finally discovered in 1940, but would not be published until after World War II in 1950. This translation and its annotations draw on multiple Japanese editions, but borrow most heavily from the interpretations offered by Tsugita Kasumi.</p><p>In about 1307 a remarkable woman in Japan sat down to complete the story of her life.

Each circuit is connected to certain behaviors and personality traits--the second circuit, for example, is connected to emotional consciousness, such as intuition, feelings of courage, or, in its unbalanced state, aggression and domination, and the eighth circuit, the creative circuit of quantum consciousness, is related to limitless perception, understanding, and action that extends far beyond the limits of planet Earth. <br> <br>Laurent Huguelit explains how these eight levels of awareness are interconnected through feedback loops, forming a cybernetic mapping of the soul. He explores the underactive, overactive, and balanced states of each circuit, offering many psychological profiles as examples. He reveals how activating a circuit that has been neglected can help bring another into balance. Connecting this model of conscious evolution to shamanism--the oldest consciousness science known to man--the author explains how to balance and upgrade your own circuits through shamanic techniques. He reveals how to reconnect with source energy by deprogramming trauma from your childhood that can affect your circuits. With access to this unlimited energy you can activate your innate creative power to manifest your desires and shape reality. <br> <br>Uniting shamanism and the law of attraction with advanced concepts of modern psychology, quantum physics, and the Akashic field theory of Ervin Laszlo, Laurent Huguelit offers a practical map of human consciousness and the development of the soul as well as a vision for the cybernetic future of shamanism.</p><p>Laurent Huguelit is a shamanic practitioner and teacher, founder of L&#x2019;Outre-Monde center for shamanic practice, and member of the European faculty of the Foundation for Shamanic Studies, founded by anthropologist Michael Harner.

In exploring the energy layers that make up Reality with a capital &#x201c;R,&#x201d; they have drawn up numerous cosmological maps and refined techniques aimed at using the potentialities of these energy layers to make life on Earth easier and more pleasant. Their practicality and open-mindedness are such that today they are still looking for new solutions to new problems without limiting themselves with considerations of &#x201c;objectivity&#x201d; or &#x201c;truth.&#x201d; Their position has always been very clear: <i>what is objective is what is perceived and what is true is what works. </i>And no possibility is to be set aside. <br> <br>Historians of religion and anthropologists have observed that a universal cosmology has been used by the shamans of all traditions. This cosmology, which proceeds directly out of explorations of the multidimensional consciousness of the sixth circuit (the psychic circuit), is called the <i>cosmology of the three worlds</i>. The non-ordinary reality the shamans experience when their souls travel is divided into three distinct regions: the Lower World , the Middle World, and the Upper World. <br> <br>The shamanic journey is made possible by the use of specific techniques aimed at stimulating an altered state of consciousness that opens the doors to these three worlds. On this psychic journey, the shaman develops his cartography of Reality, learns healing techniques, and enters into contact with the inhabitants of the non-ordinary worlds--the spirits. <br><b> <br>THREE WORLDS, THREE PAIRS</b> <br> <br>Cybernetic shamanism is a futurist form of shamanic practice that combines explorative and creative techniques of shamanism with cybernetics. The map it allows us to draw completes the map of three worlds from traditional shamanism in an innovative way. Given that yesterday&#x2019;s future is today we can bet that this innovative form of shamanic practice is appearing just when it&#x2019;s needed. <br> <br>The Lower World is the world of telluric energies through which the shaman connects to the survival instinct. This is why the spirits the shaman contacts in this world are often the animal spirits called <i>power animals</i>. They allow him to develop his anchoring to the earth and his capacity to take full responsibility for his survival. The Lower World is also inhabited by the <i>spirits of dead shamans</i> who help the living shamans accomplish their tasks. <br> <br>It is thanks to the Lower World and the root/somatic circuit pair that the shaman is in contact with nature. Without nature he can no longer do his work, for he knows deep inside that <i>only nature can balance the functioning of the being</i>. Therefore the shaman seeks to reestablish the link that connects the individual to nature, making him a specialist in the Lower World--a world that has been left behind by numerous spiritual traditions aligned toward the Heavens and the &#x201c;elevation&#x201d; of the soul. From a shamanic point of view it is totally absurd to want to &#x201c;elevate&#x201d; the soul without being firmly anchored to the earth, and that is why shamanic work generally begins by caring for and stabilizing the root (first) circuit of the being. <i>Without nature, there is no shamanism, no life, no humanity</i>. <br> <br>For shamans, the renunciation of the Lower World, power animals, and nature is at the root of most human problems. This is why the <i>healing shaman&#x2019;s</i> work is primarily with the root/somatic (first/fifth) circuit pair, which generally represents the wounded and uprooted part of the body and soul of the individual. The healing shaman&#x2019;s first therapeutic action often involves bringing in their power animal for the people seeking their help. <br> <br>Midwives participate in welcoming the being to Earth at the moment when its root circuit is malleable. Since the beginning of time they have played a fundamental shamanic role by accompanying mothers-to-be in the process of opening, leading to a harmonious delivery. It is natural that we find them beside healing shamans of the root/somatic circuit pair. In fact long before social functions became separated and compartmentalized, shamans and midwives were often one and the same person. <br> <br>The politico-territorial/psychic (second/sixth) circuit pair is mobile, active, and expansive. It is a pair used by hunters, warriors, and explorer shamans. It corresponds to the Middle World, a world of great power in which the ego has a tendency to become encrusted. This is the world from which shamans draw their power, but also the world in which they must be cautious of issues of spiritual interference. <br> <br>The spirits that help the shaman in the Middle World take on a multitude of forms. They generally live on the hidden, or non-ordinary, side of ordinary reality--the spirits of the elements (water, earth, fire, air), the spirits of nature, or the spirits of ancestors or the dead who have not yet moved on to the hereafter. <br> <br>Unlike the power animals of the Lower World that graciously help the shaman, the spirits of the Middle World are not <i>transcendental</i>, but often <i>ethnocentric</i> or even <i>egocentric</i>. The power they give to the shaman must be used with vigilance because it is rarely without cost. In the Middle World it is &#x201c;tit-for-tat.&#x201d; This does not mean the Middle World is &#x201c;evil&#x201d; or &#x201c;dangerous,&#x201d; it simply works according to different rules than the Upper and Lower Worlds. <br> <br>Finally the intellectual/mystic-religious (third/seventh) circuit pair corresponds to the Upper World, a shamanic world of knowledge and wisdom visited for millennia by the mystics of the great spiritual traditions from every continent. Within this world the <i>visionary shaman</i> comes into contact with the laws of the Universe and learns to live in harmony with them. He is at once prophet, diviner, and meditator. <br> <br>The allies of the Upper World are spiritual beings--guides, devas, masters, religious archetypes--who often demonstrate detachment and reflexivity, two qualities proceeding directly from the intellectual/mystic-religious circuit pair. These are compassionate transcendental spirits, which means they help the shamans freely.</p><h2>Collusion: Secret Meetings, Dirty Money, and How Russia Helped Donald Trump Win</h2><p><b>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</b><br> &nbsp;<br><b>An explosive expos� that lays out the story behind the Steele Dossier, including&nbsp;<b>Russia&#x2019;s decades-in-the-making political game to upend American democracy and&nbsp;</b>the Trump administration&#x2019;s ties to Moscow.</b><br><br>&#x201c;Harding...presents a powerful case for Russian interference, and Trump campaign collusion, by collecting years of reporting on Trump&#x2019;s connections to Russia and putting it all together in a coherent narrative.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The Nation</i><b><br> </b>&nbsp;<br> December 2016.

A mixture of shabby and genteel. There&#x2019;s a railway terminus, a bus station, and&#x2014;a little farther on&#x2014; a triangular park. Here you can find a statue of the French World War I hero Marshal Ferdinand Foch sitting on a horse. Written on the plinth are Foch&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;I am conscious of having served England . . .&#x201d; Someone has added in black pen: &#x201c;by murdering thousands.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a zone of arrivals and departures. Around Foch are tall plane trees and brown benches splattered white with pigeon droppings. There are tourists, commuters, and the odd hirsute bum, sipping from a can of lager and muttering. The man who owns this prime slice of real estate is the Duke of Westminster. He&#x2019;s Britain&#x2019;s wealthiest aristocrat.<br> &nbsp;<br> Keep going and you reach a row of tall neoclassical houses, done in French Renaissance style. This is Grosvenor Gardens. The street looks onto the back wall of a world-famous resi�dence, Buckingham Palace. With a bit of pluck and a long lad�der you might vault directly into Her Majesty&#x2019;s private back garden. Its fir trees, poking into the gray London skyline, are visible to commoners. The Queen&#x2019;s lake is unseen.<br> &nbsp;<br> Some of the houses here announce their inhabitants: PR firm, Japanese restaurant, language school. But at number 9-11 Grosvenor Gardens there&#x2019;s no clue as to who or what is inside. Two pillars frame an anonymous black front door. There&#x2019;s a closed-circuit TV sign. No names on the door buzzer. Above, three floors of offices.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you enter and turn right, you find yourself in a modest ground-floor suite: a couple of bare rooms painted ivory white, a medium-sized color map of the world fixed to one wall, white blinds just above street level on high windows. There are com�puters, and newspapers, too: a copy of the London <i>Times</i>. The impression is of a small, discreet, professional operation.<br> &nbsp;<br> The office is home to a British firm, Orbis Business Intel�ligence Ltd. Orbis&#x2019;s website says it&#x2019;s a &#x201c;leading corporate intel�ligence consultancy.&#x201d; It adds, vaguely: &#x201c;We provide senior decision-makers with strategic insight, intelligence and investi�gative services. We then work with clients to implement strate�gies which protect their interests worldwide.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Decoded, Orbis is in the nonstate spying business. It spies for commercial clients&#x2014;delving into the secrets of individuals and institutions, governments and international organizations. London is the global capital of private intelligence. &#x201c;A tough sector,&#x201d; in the words of one former British spy, who worked in it for a year before landing a job with a large corporation. There are more than a dozen such firms, staffed mostly by former intelligence officers specializing in foreign know-how.<br> &nbsp;<br> This isn&#x2019;t quite the world of classic espionage or James Bond. But it&#x2019;s not far from it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The man who runs Orbis is called Christopher Steele. Steele and his business partner, Christopher Burrows, are Orbis&#x2019;s directors. Both are British. Steele is fifty-two; Burrows a little older, fifty-eight. Their names don&#x2019;t appear on Orbis&#x2019;s public material. Nor is there mention of their former careers. A pair of bright younger graduates work alongside them. They form a small team.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steele&#x2019;s office gives few clues as to the nature of his under�cover work.<br> &nbsp;<br> There&#x2019;s only one hint.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lined up near the director&#x2019;s desk are nesting Russian dolls, or <i>matryoshki</i>. A souvenir from Moscow. They feature Russia&#x2019;s great nineteenth-century writers: Tolstoy, Gogol, Lermontov, Pushkin. The dolls are hand-painted and have the names of the authors written toward the base in florid Cyrillic characters. The uppercase <i>T </i>of Tolstoy resembles a swirling Greek pi.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the tumultuous days of 2016, the dolls were as good a metaphor as any for the astonishing secret investigation Steele had recently been asked to do. It was an explosive assign�ment&#x2014;to uncover the Kremlin&#x2019;s innermost secrets with rela�tion to one Donald J. Trump, to unnest them one by one, like so many dolls, until the truth was finally revealed. Its conclu�sions would shake the American intelligence community and cause a political earthquake not seen since the dark days of President Richard Nixon and Watergate. <br> &nbsp;<br> Steele&#x2019;s findings were sensational, and the resulting dossier would in effect accuse President-elect Trump of the gravest of crimes: collusion with a foreign power. That power was Rus�sia. The alleged crime&#x2014;vehemently denied, contested, and in certain key respects unprovable&#x2014;was treason. The new U.S. president designate was, it was whispered, a traitor.<br> &nbsp;<br> To find a plot that crazy, you had to turn to fiction: Richard Condon&#x2019;s <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, about a Soviet-Chinese operation to seize the White House. Or a largely forgotten thriller by the writer Ted Allbeury, <i>The Twentieth Day of Janu�ary</i>. In this one, Moscow recruits a young American during the 1968 Paris student riots who goes on to greater things. Like Steele, Allbeury was a former British intelligence officer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until his work was brought blindingly into the light, Steele was unknown. Unknown, that is, beyond a narrow circle of U.S. and UK government intelligence insiders and Russia experts. That was the way he preferred it.<br> &nbsp;<br> The year 2016 was an extraordinary historical moment. First, Brexit, Britain&#x2019;s shock decision to leave the European Union. Then, to the surprise and dismay of many Americans&#x2014;not to mention others around the world&#x2014;Donald J. Trump was unexpectedly elected that November as the United States&#x2019; forty-fifth president.<br> &nbsp;<br> The campaign that got him to the White House had been rancorous, divisive, and mean-spirited. Looming above the campaign was this single and scarcely believable accusation: a foreign leader traditionally seen as an enemy of the United States had secretly helped Trump in his against-the-odds presi�dential campaign&#x2014;maybe even nudging him across the line to victory. Trump, went the claim, was the Kremlin&#x2019;s candidate. He was a puppet of Putin, whom top Republicans had previ�ously regarded as a cold-eyed KGB villain&#x2014;&#x201c;a murderer and a thug,&#x201d; according to John McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona. Someone who wished America ill.<br> &nbsp;<br> At this point, the accusation of collusion with Moscow stuck for two reasons. First, there was Trump&#x2019;s own curious behavior on the campaign trail. Faced with claims that Russia was hack�ing Democratic emails, and leaking them to damage his rival, Hillary Clinton, Trump publicly urged Moscow to keep going.<br> &nbsp;<br> At a July 2016 press conference in Florida, he said this:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Russia, if you&#x2019;re listening, I hope you&#x2019;re able to find the thirty thousand emails that are missing. I think you will prob�ably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let&#x2019;s see if that hap�pens.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> As a Clinton aide pointed out, this was a straightforward appeal to a foreign power to commit espionage against a politi�cal opponent. Was this Trump opportunism? Or something more coordinated, more sinister?<br> &nbsp;<br> Few doubted that the emails released via WikiLeaks in June and October 2016 hurt the Democratic candidate. In and of themselves, they weren&#x2019;t especially scandalous. To an unscru�pulous adversary like Trump, however, they were a present, a great gift: an opportunity to grab the media cycle by the neck and to shake home the message of &#x201c;Crooked Hillary.&#x201d; Also rel�evant was the fact that Moscow had stolen Republican National Committee emails, too. Only it hadn&#x2019;t published them.<br> &nbsp;<br> Second, how to explain Trump&#x2019;s consistent praise of Putin? In the febrile months leading up to the November 8, 2016, vote, Trump had lambasted not only Clinton and Obama but also his Republican Party rivals, <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, the &#x201c;failing&#x201d; <i>New York Times</i>, the U.S. media in general&#x2014;his favor�ite enemy&#x2014;and Meryl Streep. And others. It was a long list.<br> &nbsp;<br> Russia&#x2019;s president, by contrast, was lauded as &#x201c;very smart.&#x201d; Putin was practically the only person on the planet to escape Trump&#x2019;s sweeping invective, delivered in semiliterate exclama�tory style via Twitter, at a time when most sane people were in bed. Trump was willing to verbally assault anyone who queried his behavior&#x2014;anyone but his friend Putin.<br> &nbsp;<br> The budding Trump-Putin friendship couldn&#x2019;t merely be explained by personal chemistry; they hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;it appeared&#x2014;met. Sure, there were ideological similarities: a contempt for international bodies such as the UN and a dislike of the Euro�pean Union. And, you might argue, Christian-inflected white nationalism. But this wasn&#x2019;t quite enough. It was as if there were a strange fealty at work, an unexplained factor, an invis�ible hand, a missing piece of the puzzle. Trump didn&#x2019;t praise any other foreign leader in quite the same way. Or as often. His obeisance to Putin would continue even as he ascended to office.<br> &nbsp;<br> These two issues&#x2014;the promotion of Russia&#x2019;s hacked emails and the praise of Putin&#x2014;raised a remarkable question. Had Putin somehow been <i>blackmailing </i>the candidate? If not, how to explain Trump&#x2019;s infatuation? If yes, blackmailing how, exactly?<br> &nbsp;<br> There were plenty of rumors, of course. Some of them had reached my newspaper, <i>The Guardian</i>. In the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election, and in the feverish and dumbfound�ing period afterward, investigative journalists on both sides of the Atlantic were pursuing a number of leads. This was a dif�ficult, frustrating, and tantalizing business. There were doubts about sources. Some of the dirt on Trump came from people close to the Clinton campaign, people with an ax to grind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Nevertheless, this was, we realized, potentially the most important U.S. political story in a generation. If Trump had indeed conspired with Russia, not only publicly but perhaps covertly, too, via undisclosed back-channels, that looked like treachery. It was Watergate all over again.<br> &nbsp;<br> But this time around, the &#x201c;burglars&#x201d; weren&#x2019;t low-level Nixon operatives. They weren&#x2019;t even Americans. According to the CIA and the FBI, they were anonymous hackers working for Putin&#x2019;s spy agencies. The cash paying their salaries was Rus�sian&#x2014;and possibly American. They didn&#x2019;t bust into the DNC using lock picks, surgical gloves, and bugging equipment, like their 1972 counterparts.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, they penetrated the DNC&#x2019;s computer networks&#x2014;an ingress by the brute method of thousands of phishing emails. The operation, the FBI would conclude, was simple and inexpensive. It was devastatingly effective. And perhaps proof that America&#x2019;s political systems were more vulnerable to shadowy electronic forces than anyone had thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, Trump hadn&#x2019;t exactly helped our efforts to establish the truth. Breaking with all precedent, he refused to disclose his tax returns. His global real estate empire was hid�den behind a network of several hundred opaque companies. Visualized as a graphic, Trump&#x2019;s corporate holdings looked like a giant exploding puffball.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was Trump a multibillionaire, as he flamboyantly claimed? Or was he in fact broke and overleveraged, owing large sums of money to banks abroad? What financial ties, if any, did he have to foreign governments? What might be said of his family, in particular the future president&#x2019;s powerful son-in-law, Jared Kushner?<br> &nbsp;<br> In December 2016, Nick Hopkins, a <i>Guardian </i>colleague, and I went to see Chris Steele to ask him these and other ques�tions. Hopkins is the paper&#x2019;s investigations editor. He had met Steele previously and knew of his expertise on Russia. This was my expertise, too. From 2007 to 2011, I spent four years in Russia as the <i>Guardian</i>&#x2019;s Moscow bureau chief until I was put in an airport cell and deported from the country. This, I am sure, was a result of some of my less flattering reports on Vladimir Putin.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was a Thursday afternoon, two and a half weeks before Christmas. London&#x2019;s streets were crowded and hectic with shoppers. We traveled by underground from the <i>Guardian</i>&#x2019;s office near Kings Cross. At Victoria Station we got out and walked the short distance to Grosvenor Gardens&#x2014;past Mar�shal Foch and his entourage of pigeons.<br> &nbsp;<br> We buzzed the front door of Orbis. They decided to let us in. Steele greeted us. He was of medium height, dressed in a plain suit, with once-black hair now mostly gray, friendly in manner but with an edge of reserve that was entirely under�standable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Journalists and spies have traditionally viewed each other with suspicion. In some respects, they are engaged in the same trade: cultivating sources, collecting and sifting information, separating fact from fiction. Both write for an audience. A newspaper&#x2019;s audience is anybody with an Internet connection. Spies write for a small official circle, cleared for secrets. Often, I imagine, the product is the same. The spies have one advan�tage. They receive material obtained from state eavesdropping and secret sources. <br> &nbsp;<br> Steele had agreed to chat over four o&#x2019;clock tea. By this point his investigation had not made worldwide headlines. He had not yet removed himself from the public eye, so the three of us returned to the street and looked for a spot to grab a cup of tea.<br> &nbsp;<br> We tried Balls Brothers&#x2014;a caf� and wine bar, its green awnings overlooking Lower Grosvenor Garden. A waitress told us they had no space: the tables were reserved for Christ�mas office parties. We wandered across the road into a pub, the Shakespeare, its name marked in letters of black against gold. A portrait of the bard himself hung above the entrance.<br> &nbsp;<br> We found a tucked-away table. I went to the bar and came back with drinks: beer for Steele, Coke for Nick, pot of tea for me. The decor had a railway theme, publicity for the Great Western Railway. There were old black-and-white photos of men in flat caps reading in a carriage and young women splash�ing in the sea at a beach.<br> &nbsp;<br> Steele was someone who liked being in the shadows, away from publicity or fuss.

This book is the result&#x2014;an effort to picture that life truly and realistically. It is the story of an energetic and capable girl, the child of German immigrant parents, who at the age of seventeen married a young German farmer, and moved to a homestead on the wind-swept plains of Kansas, where she reared eleven of her twelve children, and remembering regretfully her own half-day in school, sent nine of them through college. It is a story of grim and tenacious devotion in the face of hardships and disappointments, devotion that never flagged until the long, hard task of near a lifetime was done."&#x2014;John Ise (from the preface) <br><br>Deeply moved by his mother's memories of a waning era and rapidly disappearing lifestyle, John Ise painstakingly recorded the adventures and adversities of his family and boyhood neighbors&#x2014;the early homesteaders of Osborne County, Kansas. First published in 1936, his "nonfiction novel" Sod and Stubble has since become a widely read and much loved classic. In the original, Ise changed some identities and time sequences but accurately retained the uplifting and disheartening realities of prairie life. Von Rothenberger brings us a new annotated and expanded edition that greatly enhances Ise's timeless tale. He includes the entire first edition-replete with Ise's charm, wit, and veracity, restores four of Ise's original chapters that have never been published, and adds photographs of many of the key characters. In his notes, Rothenberger reveals the true identity of Ise's family and neighbors, provides background on their lives, and places events within a wider historical and geographical context. <br><br>Ushering us through a dynamic period of pioneering history, from the 1870s to the turn of the century, <i>Sod and Stubble</i> abounds with the events and issues&#x2014;fires and droughts, parties and picnics, insect infestations and bumper crops, prosperity and poverty, divisiveness and generosity, births and deaths&#x2014;that shaped the lives and destinies of Henry and Rosa Ise, their family, and their community. <br><br>One hundred and twenty-five years after Osborne County was organized and Henry Ise homesteaded his claim, a corner of nineteenth-century Kansas social history remains safeguarded thanks to the tenacity of John Ise and the insight of Von Rotheberger, who enlivens Ise's story with revealing detail.</p><p>The Unabridged and Annotated Edition: With additional material by Von Rothenberger.

Comparing and contrasting both AS and non-AS partners&#39; viewpoints, this book frankly examines the fundamental aspects of relationships that are often complicated by the disorder. With all findings illustrated with case examples taken from interviews conducted with couples, the author tackles issues such as attraction, trust, communication, sex and intimacy, and parenting.

The result is that their inner pictures are devoid of life. <br><br>To arrive at a truth or to create beauty that reflects the order and harmony of the Creator, we must always begin humbly, in ignorance and ugliness. By striving out of ignorance and ugliness toward the true and beautiful, both scientists and artists can bring new, creative forces into the world. Neither memorizing data nor copying a beautiful drawing engages the true imagination of students as it is by drawing a flower from life. It is precisely this lack of an active, striving inner creativity that can result in the frequently overwhelming feelings of anxiety and alienation experienced by so many people today. As a counterbalance, education must&#x2015;in all areas of knowledge&#x2015;increasingly focus on the personal creation of what, through its beauty, speaks truth and through its truth radiates beauty. <br><br><b><i>Drawing from the Book of Nature</i></b>&nbsp;is about both drawing and the natural world of plants and animals.

The progressive answer is that America has failed to live up to its full promise of inclusiveness and equality--likely the result of corporate greed and white male ruling elites. The mainstream conservative or libertarian's reply points to the Warren Court, the 1960's, or a loss of Constitutional rectitude. Christopher Ferrara, in <i>Liberty, the God That Failed</i>, offers an entirely different answer. In a counter-narrative of unique power and scope, he unmasks the order promised as a sham; the liberty guaranteed, a chimera. In his telling, the false god of a new political order--Liberty--was born in thought long before America's founding, and gained increasing devotion as it slowly amassed power during the first century of the nation's existence. Today it reveals its full might, as we bear the weight of its oppressive decrees, and experience the emptiness of the secular order it imposes upon us.<br><br>Ferrara destroys multiple myths constructed by the secular state with a relentless uncovering of truths hidden by both liberal and conservative/libertarian accounts of what has gone wrong. In this brilliant retelling of American history and political life, the author asks us to open our eyes to harsh realities, but also to the possibilities for a rightly ordered society and the true liberty that can still be ours.</p><p><b>Christopher A.

Bats most naturally hang upside down and are good at it. Murray was a bit of a show-off anyway, so he swung by his toes whenever anyone passing by happened to look up.<br> <br>Murray was Stumpy&#x2019;s tree mate, best friend, and self-appointed uncle to her three children: Sparrow, Top, and Bottom. And he could be a very naughty influence, as when he taught the children to hang by their toes, and they drew all sorts of remarks from the park residents as a result.<br> <br>Most remarks were kind, as when Old Badger said she had never seen such clever squirrels in all her days.<br> <br><br> <br>Some remarks were neutral, as when the raven simply commented that toes were neither good nor bad, they just were.<br> <br>And a few remarks were plainly mean and of course issued forth from the mouths of the weasels, every one of whom remarked that it would probably be a good idea if a certain squirrel mother taught her children some etiquette.<br> <br>&#x201c;Etiquette?&#x201d; repeated Murray when Stumpy told him about this insult. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that where New Yorkers go for the weekend?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Stumpy, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s Connecticut. Etiquette is manners.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Manners!&#x201d; shrieked Murray, who enjoyed drama. &#x201c;Manners! If I had manners, I&#x2019;d starve!&#x201d;<br> <br>(Murray was referring to the fact that he regularly pilfered egg rolls from the Dumpster by the Chinese restaurant down the street. And doughnuts from the bakery Dumpster on the other side of the park. And enchiladas from the Taco Craze Dumpster over by the freeway. The list could go on for miles.)<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Stumpy, &#x201c;mothers are sensitive.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And weasels are rats,&#x201d; said Murray. &#x201c;Rats in weasel clothing.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stumpy sighed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gwendolyn would understand,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Gwendolyn understands everything.&#x201d;<br> <br>Murray nodded in agreement.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because she&#x2019;s a hundred and four years old,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;She is not!&#x201d; cried Stumpy. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just wise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Gwendolyn is wise and a hundred and four years old,&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are counting all her past lives she told us about,&#x201d; said Stumpy. &#x201c;In hermit crab time Gwendolyn is just, well, she is just . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A hundred and four,&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for goodness&#x2019; sake,&#x201d; said Stumpy.<br> <br>Gwendolyn was Stumpy and Murray&#x2019;s dear, dear friend. They could not imagine how they had ever managed without her. Gwendolyn might be a hermit crab, but she understood each of them perfectly. She gave Stumpy&#x2014;who was something of a worrier&#x2014;the very best advice about rearing young children. (Gwendolyn&#x2019;s advice always solved the problem.) And Gwendolyn praised Murray&#x2019;s heart, which was actually quite a big heart, but one that Murray hid behind a million funny lines.<br> <br>Gwendolyn never let her bat friend get away with this.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are a shining emblem of love to those children,&#x201d; Gwendolyn often said to Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shining plum?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shining emblem,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;A shiny Indian?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Emblem,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>&#x201c;Envelope?&#x201d; said Murray.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, for goodness&#x2019; sake,&#x201d; said Gwendolyn.<br> <br>But Murray really did hear her. And it made him proud.<br> <br><br> <br>The true hero among them all, of course, was the one who said very little about love or courage or wisdom but excelled at all three. And this true hero&#x2019;s name was Kona.<br> <br>Kona was a chocolate Labrador who lived a quiet dog&#x2019;s life with Gwendolyn and their human, Professor Albert.<br> <br>It had been well over a year since Kona had faced the greatest challenge of his life by rescuing Stumpy&#x2019;s three children. This had happened during a most terrifying ice storm that ravaged the trees of Gooseberry Park, among those the great pin oak where Stumpy&#x2019;s babies had just been born.<br> <br>With Murray&#x2019;s help, and Gwendolyn&#x2019;s help, Kona managed to hide the children he had rescued by placing them in the Christmas decorations in Professor Albert&#x2019;s basement until Stumpy&#x2014;who had gone missing in the storm&#x2014;was found.<br> <br><br> <br>It was during this time that Murray developed a strong attachment to television and Oreo cookies. Both were still central to his life. And he had since then sneaked into Professor Albert&#x2019;s house on warm summer days&#x2014;easing open the screen door with his sneaky little foot&#x2014;so he could have a cookie and watch Jeopardy! with Gwendolyn. Professor Albert was usually napping in the hammock.<br> <br>So life for these fine friends and for Professor Albert had been very rich since the ice storm, and the three squirrel babies&#x2014;once sheltered by a chocolate Labrador and a hermit crab in a human&#x2019;s house&#x2014;had grown taller and rounder and stronger. And they could hang by their toes.<br> <br>Life had been very rich and very quiet.<br> <br>But the very quiet part was about to change.</p><h2>The Long War (Long Earth, 2)</h2><p><p><em>The Long War</em> by Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter follows the adventures and travails of heroes Joshua Valiente and Lobsang in an exciting continuation of the extraordinary science fiction journey begun in their <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>The Long Earth.</em><br>&nbsp;<br>A generation after the events of T<em>he Long Earth</em>, humankind has spread across the new worlds opened up by &#x201c;stepping.&#x201d; A new &#x201c;America&#x201d;&#x2014;Valhalla&#x2014;is emerging more than a million steps from Datum&#x2014;our Earth.

While police and the media are quick to paint participants as anarchistic thugs, accurate accounts of their ubsequent treatment at the hands of authorities often go untold as well as the myriad stories of corporate and government corruption, greed, exploitation, and abuse of power that inspired such protests in the first place. In this startling, politically astute graphic novel, Gord Hill (<i>The 500 Years of Resistance Comic Book</i>) documents the history of capitalism as well as anti-capitalist and anti-globalization movements around the world, from the 1999 Battle of Seattle&#x201d; against the World Trade Organization to the Toronto G20 summit in 2010. The dramatic accounts trace the global origins of public protests against those in power, then depict recent events based on eyewitness testimony; they go far to contradict the myths of violence perpetrated by authorities, and instead paint a vivid and historically accurate picture of activists who bring the crimes of governments and multinationals to the world&#x2019;s attention.<br><br>As the Occupy&#x201d; movements around the world unfold, <i>The Anti-Capitalist Resistance Comic Book</i> is a deft, eye-opening look at the new class warfare, and those brave enough to wage the battle.</p><br><br></p><p>Gord Hill is an artist and activist, and a member of the Kwakwaka'wakw nation whose territory is located on northern Vancouver Island and adjacent mainland in the province of British Columbia.&#x201d; He is also descended from Scottish and Tlingit great grandparents.

On French Prairie in the newly forming Oregon Territory, Marie strives to meet the needs of her conflict-ridden neighbors: British settlers and Americans, missionaries and disease-stricken natives, fur trappers and French Canadian farming families, and the surviving natives of the region.<br><br>At the same time, as a mother, Marie must weave together the threads of an unraveling family. One daughter compares and judges as she seeks to find her place; another reaches for elusive evidence of her mother&#x2019;s love. Marie&#x2019;s memories are threatened with the emergence of a figure from the past. In the midst of this turmoil, Marie discovers an empowering spiritual truth: Unconditional love can shed light on even the darkest places in the heart.</p><p><b>Jane Kirkpatrick</b> is a best-selling author whose novels include the BookSense 76 Selection <i>A Name of Her Own, Every Fixed Star, </i>and the acclaimed Kinship and Courage series: <i>All Together in One Place, No Eye Can See, </i>and <i>What Once We Loved. </i>Jane is a winner of the Wrangler Award from the Western Heritage Center and National Cowboy Hall of Fame.<b> </b>She is also a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, inspirational retreat leader, and speaker.<i> </i><b>Chapter One</b><br><br><b>Bright Shining Light</b><br><i><br>August 1841, French Prairie, Oregon Country<br></i><br>Marie let loose her daughter&#x2019;s hand, then stepped behind her, gently guiding her into the darkness. <i>&#x201c;Maintenant,&#x201d; </i>she said in French. &#x201c;We go now.&#x201d; She placed her hands on the young woman&#x2019;s cedar-caped shoulders, inhaled the wood scent of her hair. They were nearly the same height, one of the few things they shared in common&#x2013;that and a worry over whether they&#x2019;d be enough.<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have time for this, Mother,&#x201d; Marguerite protested. But<br>she allowed Marie to prod her to an area of prairie grass where Marie<br>motioned her daughter to sit.<br><br>&#x201c;We need to make time for this,&#x201d; Marie said. &#x201c;Lie down.&#x201d; She patted<br>the grass.<br><br>A vast darkness arched over her and her oldest daughter. The women&#x2019;s<br>heads touched, as though they were two logs reaching out from a center<br>post. The air felt moist. The moon would rise late tonight. The dry<br>grasses tickled her ankles. She should have put on leggings before convincing<br>her oldest daughter to walk a distance from their log home to<br>feel the night air breathe in the dark sky. Getting Marguerite to come<br>with her at all had taken convincing. Dozens of tasks waited finishing<br>before the big event tomorrow. &#x201c;There will never be another night like<br>this one, not ever,&#x201d; Marie told her daughter. Marie meant to savor it.<br>She&#x2019;d begun to cherish these feathers of peaceful moments floating into<br>her life, even when it took effort. It still took such effort to name the<br>good in her days. Learning new ways, she found, both stimulated and<br>strained her. This was a happy occasion. She refused to let worry scar it,<br>and so she controlled her troublesome thoughts, even now, when they<br>pushed like a bullish child elbowing his way in uninvited.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see that?&#x201d; Marie asked. She pointed. &#x201c;That light? There&#x2019;s<br>a special prize for the one who sees the first star.&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite shook her head, rubbing Marie&#x2019;s hair as she did. &#x201c;Papa<br>Jean&#x2019;s spectacles must let you see something I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s still just dark sky<br>to me, Mother. Where did you see it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;East,&#x201d; Marie said. She adjusted the lenses given her as a gift by her<br>husband just weeks before. &#x201c;Toward Hood&#x2019;s Mountain. An arc of light.<br>There&#x2019;s another.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see them. Maybe they&#x2019;re coming to find us with the<br>lanterns.&#x201d; Marguerite said. &#x201c;Maybe they think I&#x2019;ve changed my mind<br>and have run away.&#x201d;<br><br>Did her daughter warn her of worries? The man was twenty years<br>her daughter&#x2019;s senior. He had sons already. Maybe Marguerite wished<br>more time before she committed to this man Jean Baptiste Gobin.<br>Does a mother encourage her daughter to walk through the uncertainty<br>of marriage, promising her that peace will come, or does she make a<br>safe place for a daughter to turn around, to reconsider her heart&#x2019;s<br>future?<br><br>What was right for a mother to do? was always Marie&#x2019;s question.<br><br>Ripe gooseberries scented the August air. An owl hooted in the big<br>cedar tree in the center of the timbered section that marked the border<br>of their land. Prairie wolves howled in the distance, a sound distinct<br>from the larger wolves that roamed in packs. Marie took in a deep<br>breath. There were more blessings here than dangers; that&#x2019;s what she<br>must concentrate on, encourage her daughter to think this too. New<br>ways took time. Her friend Sarah had told her that long years before,<br>and Sarah was seldom wrong. Unlike Marie, who was a mother named<br>by her errors.<br><br>She took another deep breath. She would count her blessings like<br>the beads of her rosary, designed, orderly, and obvious, the way the<br>priests said God revealed himself in the created world. Hadn&#x2019;t her husband<br>of many years become her friend, someone with whom she preferred<br>to spend her time? That must have been part of a grand design.<br>Wasn&#x2019;t this prairie land they&#x2019;d found to live in ripe with promise, predictable<br>with seasons of planting and harvest? Hadn&#x2019;t she found a quiet<br>way to ease the ache of a lost and troubled son, soothe the disappointment<br>of rarely seeing distant friends, survive the deaths of a child and<br>two husbands? The landscape, her newly forming faith, and her family<br>promised peace. These were the life threads that she wove into a healing<br>robe of comfort.<br><br>Memory, too, served her. It brought the conversations she&#x2019;d had<br>with her friend Sacagawea to mind whenever she wished. Memory<br>reminded her of what she had endured in her fifty summers. Even<br>Kilakotah she called neighbor now, though to touch her fingers to her<br>friend&#x2019;s cheeks meant a three-day ride to the horse ranch of Tom McKay.<br>Still, the two would see each other more now, when they gathered at the<br>parish church on the Willamette River when the priests traveled south<br>for Mass. And in between, she had the memories of those who brushed<br>against her and changed her life forever.<br><br>She had troubling memories too, but surely she deserved now a<br>time to set those aside, cut those ties. Her friend Sacagawea would tell<br>her to expect kindness in life. This she would do, especially tonight.<br>After all, she was a mother whose children told her their secrets and<br>honored her with their questions. What mother didn&#x2019;t want to be<br>known for her careful tongue and modest wisdom? Her husband, Jean,<br>tolerated her many wonderings over varying views of faith of native<br>people, of Presbyterians, Catholics, and Methodists who populated this<br>prairie area. Perhaps he understood that her baptism was a beginning of<br>another questioning journey and not one simply ending with acceptance<br>as it had been for him.<br><br>Marie questioned. It was part of who she was.<br><br>Marie blinked again. She&#x2019;d seen the pinpricks sometimes even in the<br>daylight, when she stood too quickly or when she first awoke. Their<br>presence interrupted her sleep, too, and she&#x2019;d awake with a start, a gasp<br>that would wake her husband and stir the household trying to sleep in<br>the upper loft.<br><br>Perhaps her eyes were learning new things even while she slept. She<br>had spectacles to wear during the day, to stop the squinting that had<br>been a part of her life for as long as she could remember. Yes, that was<br>probably all it was, her eyes adjusting to the dark and daylight, seeing<br>clearly with spectacles.<br><br>This piercing light tonight was likely just the first sign of the stars<br>filling the night sky. Nothing to be alarmed about.<br><br>&#x201c;Will this always be my home?&#x201d; Marguerite asked then. Her voice<br>had changed to wistfulness.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll always have a place with us, but you&#x2019;ll have your own home<br>after tomorrow.&#x201d; Her daughter took in a sharp breath, and her breathing<br>quickened. Marie heard discomfort in the sound. &#x201c;This is your<br>choice, <i>oui? </i>&#x201d; Marie asked. &#x201c;To marry this man?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad we moved here with Papa Jean,&#x201d; Marguerite said.<br><br>Hadn&#x2019;t her daughter heard her? Or did she deliberately avoid?<br><br>&#x201c;You might not have met your JB if we hadn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There are more French Canadians here,&#x201d; Marguerite said.<br><br>&#x201c;More people like your papa.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s one,&#x201d; Marguerite said, lifting her hand quickly to point.<br>Marie felt rather than saw her daughter&#x2019;s arm reach up. &#x201c;In the northern<br>sky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I see it too. <i>Bon. </i>You receive the treasure. You have the first star in<br>your basket,&#x201d; Marie told her.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s my prize?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It comes to you later.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You made that up, Mother. There&#x2019;s no &#x2018;first prize&#x2019; for seeing the first<br>star of a night sky.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; she said and smiled.<br><br>Marie had coaxed her daughter away from the cheek bread pans,<br>those rounded tins that resembled a baby&#x2019;s bottom when the dough<br>rose. She drew her from the chatter of Marguerite&#x2019;s younger brother<br>and sister so she could rest a bit before taking on the role of a bride. A<br>peaceful moment was her daughter&#x2019;s treasure. A new wife had few of<br>them after the wedding, and Marie wanted her daughter to have the<br>memory of a special evening before the days filled up with the work of<br>living.<br><br>Marie would have a prize too: a memory of a last quiet time with<br>her oldest daughter alone, a moment of hanging on to a daughter before<br>Marguerite became a wife.<br><br>Marie thought to offer sage advice, to say something to sustain her<br>daughter in this time of transformation when a woman became a bride.<br>Words failed her at times, even French words, her first language. Marie<br>thought of her mother. What might her own mother have spoken if she<br>had lived to see Marie&#x2019;s marriage day when, as a young girl, she had<br>committed herself to Pierre Dorion? Would she have been proud that<br>her daughter chose a man affiliated, however briefly, with the Corps of<br>Discovery? Or might she have stepped in to intervene, suggested that she<br>was too young to wed?<br><br>No way to know. Her mother had died before Marie spoke marriage<br>vows.<br><br>Marie was pleased her daughter had waited until she was twentytwo<br>to marry. And her youngest girl, Marianne, while fifteen, showed<br>little interest in boys. A blessing. Marie touched the beads around her<br>neck, ran her hand over the smooth metal cross that her friend Sarah<br>had given her. Blessings. Count the blessings.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you thinking about, Mother?&#x201d; Marguerite asked. The<br>girl had a gravelly voice, husky almost, her throat scorched perhaps from<br>leaning over the cook fires. Marie imagined the tiny wrinkles that<br>flowed like rivers toward the pools of her daughter&#x2019;s dark eyes, eyes that<br>tonight looked tired even before the wedding plans consumed her. As a<br>child, Marguerite had been known by the French Canadians for her<br>thick eyebrows lifting in question and by her firm lips reserving expression<br>for rare occasions. Even with impending joy so close, Marguerite&#x2019;s<br>full round face hadn&#x2019;t eased often into a smile. Marie wished something<br>different for Marguerite.<br><br>&#x201c;Remembering,&#x201d; Marie said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what a mother does on a day<br>before her daughter weds. A bride-to-be should have stars in her basket,<br><i>n&#x2019;est-ce pas?</i>&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite said, &#x201c;To light the darkness she finds there?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You worry over darkness?&#x201d; Marie said.<br><br>&#x201c;Just a rule of thumb,&#x201d; Marguerite said.<br><br>Marie shivered. Such a phrase. Could this JB Gobin be a man who<br>used the rod against his wife? Had she missed some rumor about him?<br>Why otherwise had her daughter chosen the term <i>rule of thumb, </i>the<br>legal size of a rod allowed by a husband to strike his wife?<br><br>&#x201c;Does he hurt you, this Gobin? You do not need to marry him,<br>then.&#x201d; Marie sat up. Her daughter was asking for a way out.<br><br>&#x201c;No. No.&#x201d; Marguerite answered quickly, pulled her mother back. &#x201c;I<br>only meant I&#x2019;m just a little worried, a slender worry, the size of a rod.<br>About...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do your thoughts go to someone else? to Richard?&#x201d;<br><br>Marguerite laughed. &#x201c;That Nez Perce boy? No. He was just a<br>friend.&#x201d; Her voice sounded light, as though she coaxed a child to eat her<br>porridge. &#x201c;No.&#x201d; Marguerite hesitated now. &#x201c;I think of Paul,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>Marie felt a chill go through her. &#x201c;The day before your wedding you<br>think of your half-brother?&#x201d; Marie moved her head, felt the hair at the<br>back of her neck bristle.<br><br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t he run away on the day Baptiste married Older Sister?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He did.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was the first wedding I remember, and it ended in sadness. Papa<br>never came back. Paul never came back. Even Baptiste left, and before<br>he returned Older Sister died.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Leave those hard thoughts behind now, Marguerite.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They never even said good-bye to me. None of them,&#x201d; Marguerite<br>said.<br><br>&#x201c;This is what you think of when you prepare to marry?&#x201d; Marie said.<br>&#x201c;<i>Non. </i>This is not good. You were little then. You should think of other<br>things. You shouldn&#x2019;t think of a sad time. See, there&#x2019;s another star. This<br>will be a full sky night.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you wonder where Paul is?&#x201d;<br><br>Another light, as tiny as a pinprick, flashed before her eyes. Marie<br>blinked, and the glimmer broke into flickers and disappeared. She felt<br>no pain, but uneasiness snaked though the tiny hole as though the<br>opening might rip into something larger that could consume her. When<br>had they started, these flickering lights, tearing at the fabric of memory<br>and mind? She lived in safety, surrounded by family and friends. Why<br>did the uneasiness pierce her now?<br><br>Marie held her jaws together, made herself breathe in through her<br>nose. &#x201c;I have put my thoughts of Paul in a past place, to make room for<br>new joys, like my daughter&#x2019;s wedding.&#x201d;<br><br>Marie could hear voices in the distance. Marianne&#x2019;s girlish pitches<br>poked into her husband&#x2019;s and her son&#x2019;s low tones. Someone would be<br>calling them back soon.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you think really happened to Paul? And to Papa?&#x201d; Marguerite<br>asked. She sat up now. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re linked together for me, their disappearances.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They happened years apart,&#x201d; Marie said. &#x201c;Our memories tell tall<br>tales to us sometimes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not for me. I wonder about the stories I should tell my children<br>about their grandfather.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Papa Jean was more a part of your life. Tell your children of him.&#x201d;<br><br>Moments passed, and Marguerite sat so silent that Marie thought<br>she might have fallen asleep. Marie imagined her daughter&#x2019;s long eyelashes<br>closed against her cheeks; she reached to touch the bone beneath<br>her daughter&#x2019;s left eye, a bone left flattened when a horse raised its head<br>to Marguerite&#x2019;s and cracked it long years before. Maybe Marguerite worried<br>about injury or death, this young woman on the eve of new living.<br>Marie was no <i>femme sens�; </i>she had no explanations. Her baptism weeks<br>before had answered some questions but added even more.<br><br>&#x201c;I want to tell my children stories of Papa,&#x201d; Marguerite said, her<br>fingers clutching her mother&#x2019;s now. &#x201c;So they&#x2019;ll know about a good<br>father. He was good, <i>n&#x2019;est-ce pas? </i>He had scars in his fingers. I remember<br>that. And he sang, didn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Oui. </i>He loved music and he sewed with me. Even with his fingers<br>that would break open in icy water. Tiny stitches we used.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I think that Paul...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What? What do you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Marguerite said. She let loose her mother&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;It is a<br>never-mind thought.&#x201d;<br><br>For Marie, stories of Paul arrived on an arc of pain that hit new<br>marks each time they were spoken as words. She wanted to forget that<br>wound, put it away as she&#x2019;d put other painful times behind her, times<br>that were better tucked away as forgotten thoughts, not brought into<br>present memory. &#x201c;Tell your children of the good your stepfather<br>brought to your life. Don&#x2019;t dwell on the death of your father or the<br>disappearance of Paul or the death of your sister-in-law,&#x201d; Marie said.<br>&#x201c;Baptiste married a woman he loved. Remember that. And he is happy<br>now. He did come back. Not all who leave stay gone. Papa Jean lived<br>away for months trapping, but he always returned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Older Sister lost her life...giving birth,&#x201d; Marguerite said.

Loaded into a rickety boat with three hundred other refugees, Julie made it to Hong Kong and, ultimately, America, where a surgeon at UCLA gave her partial sight.

She was born ethnic Chinese in Vietnam. As a young child, she had cataracts that rendered her nearly blind&#x2014;her grandmother felt she would be a burden to the family and tried to have an herbalist end her life. When the family fled for the U.S., she was able to get corrective eye surgery in California. Still, she was declared legally blind due to poor vision. She earned her way into Williams College, attended Harvard Law School, married, and settled in Brooklyn with her husband and two children. Then at 37, she was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer. For five years, she dealt with the disease, took care of her family, prepared them and herself for the future, and sought understanding by writing about it. There is hope, anger, fear, reflection, immersion in the everyday, and joy reflected in this book.

Each of these structures expresses what Chaubin considers the fourth age of Soviet architecture, an unknown burgeoning that took place from 1970 until 1990.</p><p>Contrary to the 1920s and 1950s, no &#x201c;school&#x201d; or main trend emerges here. These buildings represent a chaotic impulse brought about by a decaying system. Taking advantage of the collapsing monolithic structure, architects went far beyond modernism, going back to the roots or freely innovating. Some of the daring ones completed projects that the Constructivists would have dreamt of (Druzhba Sanatorium, Yalta), others expressed their imagination in an expressionist way (Palace of Weddings, Tbilisi). A summer camp, inspired by sketches of a prototype lunar base, lays claim to Suprematist influence (Prometheus youth camp, Bogatyr).

The lessons she discloses come from fields as diverse as ecology, evolution, and cell biology. Written in the form of a Platonic dialogue among five fictional characters, <i>The Nature of Economies</i> is as astonishingly accessible and clear as it is irrepressibly brilliant and wise&#x2013;a groundbreaking yet humane study destined to become another world-altering classic.</p><p>Over the past 40 years, Jane Jacobs has produced an acclaimed series of analytical essays that examine the development of complex human systems and environments in a manner that's as literary as it is visionary. Her latest, <i>The Nature of Economies</i>, continues this artistic and provocative tradition by dissecting relationships between economics and ecology through a multilayered discourse around the fundamental premise that "human beings exist wholly within nature as part of a natural order." In a style reminiscent of the cinematic <i>My Dinner with Andre</i>, Jacobs gives us a captivating ongoing conversation between five contemporary New Yorkers who sip coffee and voice accepted, fact-based theories along with subjective but solid opinions regarding the way our society's fractal-like development is actually dependent upon "the same universal principles that the rest of nature uses." Digressing onto various and sundry paths as such dialogues always do--albeit, this time, on a very specific and methodical route as prescribed by Jacobs--the characters mull over business cycles, animal husbandry, habitat destruction, the implications of standardization and monopoly, competition in nature, the obsolescence of computers, and much, much more. This book is recommended for the eclectically curious who welcome the opportunity to eavesdrop on such stimulating table talk, even while lamenting the fact they can't join in. --<i>Howard Rothman</i>"Provocative...engaging....

Henry Award&#x2013;winning short story, "Two Brothers," to this controversial book and a new afterword, in which he describes the troubling aftermath of the book's publication in 1994.</p><p>Brian Evenson is an assistant professor of English at the University of Denver. He is the author of six books of fiction, including <i>Father of Lies and Contagion: And Other Stories</i>. Alphonso Lingis is a professor of philosophy at Penn State University. He is the author of numerous books, including The Imperative and Dangerous Emotions.Generally speaking, the shorter stories are clever and the longer ones less so--with the exception of a polished novella--in this grisly debut collection by a Gordon Lish acolyte. When Evenson writes brief stories, they have the crisp, tight feeling of Jonis Agee's best work, with a sadistic edge. Because these are so quick, their titles make them self-explanatory. ``Killing Cats'' is narrated by a man who has been asked to drive two friends so that they can do just that. A character in the title piece urges the narrator to eat the tongue of a man he has killed. ``The Abbreviated and Tragical History of The Auschwitz Barber'' does not even occupy an entire page, yet tells just the story promised by its title. The longer stories are equally gruesome, but without that punchy delivery they feel more like drawn-out jokes, and Evenson's habit of coy concealment, while successful in the shorter pieces, grates. Several tales apparently deal with the same characters, although they are so uniformly brutal that it is hard to tell. In ``The Blank'' a man named Thorne has closed himself in his room and passes notes to men on the outside, including Bosephus. Bosephus is still watching and waiting in ``A Slow Death'' and also appears in ``Extermination.'' Just showing up is not enough, however, and attention wanes as Bosephus waits while occasionally killing some animals. The novella ``The Sanza Affair'' is in many senses the most structured work here, and it is also the best. A police detective named Sanza has been killed while investigating a case, which has been passed on to an inspector named Lund. Lund finds the case as impenetrable as Sanza did, and is soon making connections between Sanza's death and his work. This subverts traditional mystery-writing techniques while still maintaining suspense. Good and bad bits from someone who has trouble recognizing when enough is enough. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He died in 1983.chapter 1I WAS dreaming about a hairless ape who lived in a cage by himself. His trouble was that people were always trying to get in. It kept the ape in a state of nervous tension. I came out of sleep sweating, aware that somebody was at the door. Not the front door, but the side door that opened into the garage. Grossing the cold kitchen linoleum in my bare feet, I saw first dawn at the window over the sink. Whoever it was on the other side of the door was tapping now, quietly and persistently. I turned on the outside light, unlocked the door, and opened it.A very large young man in dungarees stepped awkwardly backward under the naked garage bulb. There was dirt in his stubble of light hair. His unblinking pale blue eyes looked up at the light in an oddly pathetic way.&#34;Turn it off, will you?&#34;&#34;I like to be able to see.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s just it.&#34; He glanced through the open garage door, out to the quiet gray street. &#34;I don&#39;t want to be seen.&#34;&#34;You could always go away again.&#34; Then I took another look at him, and regretted my surliness. There was a kind of oily yellowish glaze on his skin which was more than a trick of the light. He could be in a bad way.He looked again at the hostile street. &#34;May I come in? You&#39;re Mr. Archer, aren&#39;t you?&#34;&#34;It&#39;s kind of early for visiting. I don&#39;t know your name.&#34;&#34;Carl Hallman. I know it&#39;s early. I&#39;ve been up all night.&#34; He swayed, and steadied himself against the doorpost. His hand was black with grime, and there were bleeding scratches on the back of it.&#34;Been in an accident, Hallman?&#34;&#34;No.&#34; He hesitated, and spoke more slowly: &#34;There was an accident. It didn&#39;t happen to me. Not the way you mean.&#34;&#34;Who did it happen to?&#34;&#34;My father. My father was killed.&#34;&#34;Last night?&#34;&#34;Six months ago. It&#39;s one of the things I want to ask you--speak to you about. Can&#39;t you give me a few moments?&#34; A pre-breakfast client was the last thing I needed that morning. But it was one of those times when you have to decide between your own convenience and the unknown quantity of another man&#39;s trouble. Besides, the other man and his way of talking didn&#39;t go with his ragbag clothes, his mud-stained work shoes. It made me curious.&#34;Come in then.&#34;He didn&#39;t seem to hear me. His glazed eyes stayed on my face too long.&#34;Come in, Hallman. It&#39;s cold in these pajamas.&#34;&#34;Oh. Sorry.&#34; He stepped up into the kitchen, almost as broad as the door. &#34;It&#39;s hellish of me to bother you like this.&#34;&#34;No bother if it&#39;s urgent.&#34;I shut the door and plugged in the coffee-maker. Carl Hallman remained standing in the middle of the kitchen floor. I pulled out a chair for him. He smelled of country.&#34;Sit down and tell me about it.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s just it. I don&#39;t know anything. I don&#39;t even know if it is urgent.&#34;&#34;Well, what&#39;s all the excitement about?&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t make much sense, do I? I&#39;ve been running half the night.&#34;&#34;Where from?&#34;&#34;A certain place. It doesn&#39;t matter where.&#34; His face closed up in blankness, almost stuporous. He was remembering that certain place.A thought I&#39;d been suppressing forced its way through. Carl Hallman&#39;s clothes were the kind of clothes they give you to wear in prison. He had the awkward humility men acquire there. And there was a strangeness in him, stranger than fear, which might be one of guilt&#39;s chameleon forms. I changed my approach:&#34;Did somebody send you to me?&#34;&#34;Yes. A friend gave me your name. You are a private detective?&#34;I nodded. &#34;Your friend has a name?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d remember him.&#34; Carl Hallman was embarrassed. He popped his dirty knuckles and looked at the floor. &#34;I don&#39;t know if my friend would want me to use his name.&#34;&#34;He used mine.&#34;&#34;That&#39;s a little different, isn&#39;t it? You hold a--sort of a public job.&#34;&#34;So I&#39;m a public servant, eh? Well, we won&#39;t play guessing games, Carl.&#34;The water in the coffee-maker boiled. It reminded me how cold I was. I went to my bedroom for a bathrobe and slippers. Looked at the gun in my closet, decided against it. When I came back to the kitchen, Carl Hallman was sitting in the same position.&#34;What are you going to do?&#34; he asked me dully.&#34;Have a cup of coffee. How about you?&#34;&#34;No, thanks. I don&#39;t care for anything.&#34;I poured him a cup, anyway, and he drank it greedily.&#34;Hungry?&#34;&#34;You&#39;re very kind, but I couldn&#39;t possibly accept--&#34;&#34;I&#39;ll fry a couple of eggs.&#34;&#34;No! I don&#39;t want you to.&#34; His voice was suddenly high, out of control. It came queerly out of his broad barrel chest, like the voice of a little boy calling from hiding. &#34;You&#39;re angry with me.&#34;I spoke to the little boy: &#34;I don&#39;t burn so easy. I asked for a name, you wouldn&#39;t give it. You have your reasons. All right. What&#39;s the matter, Carl?&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t know. When you brushed me off, just now, all I could think of was Father. He was always getting angry. That last night--&#34;I waited, but that was all. He made a noise in his throat which might have been a sob, or a growl of pain. Turned away from me and gazed at the coffee-maker on the breakfast bar. The grounds in its upper half were like black sand in a static hourglass that wouldn&#39;t let time pass. I fried six eggs in butter, and made some toast. Carl gobbled his. I gobbled mine, and poured the rest of the coffee.&#34;You&#39;re treating me very well,&#34; he said over his cup. &#34;Better than I deserve.&#34;&#34;It&#39;s a little service we provide for clients. Feeling better?&#34;&#34;Physically, yes. Mentally--&#34; He caught himself on the downbeat, and held steady. &#34;That&#39;s good coffee you make. The coffee on the ward was terrible, loaded with chicory.&#34;&#34;You&#39;ve been in a hospital?&#34;&#34;Yes. The State Hospital.&#34; He added, with some defiance: &#34;I&#39;m not ashamed of it.&#34; But he was watching closely for my reaction.&#34;What was the trouble?&#34;&#34;The diagnosis was manic-depressive. I don&#39;t think I am manic-depressive. I know I was disturbed. But that&#39;s all past.&#34;&#34;They released you?&#34;He hung his head over his coffee cup and looked at me from underneath, on the slant.&#34;Are you on the run from the hospital?&#34;&#34;Yes. I am.&#34; The words came hard to him. &#34;But it&#39;s not the way you imagine. I was virtually cured, ready to be discharged, but my brother wouldn&#39;t let them. He wants to keep me locked up.&#34; His voice fell into a singsong rhythm: &#34;As far as Jerry is concerned, I could stay there until I rotted.&#34;The melody was familiar: incarcerated people always had to be blaming someone, preferably a close relative. I said:&#34;Do you know for a fact your brother was keeping you there?&#34;&#34;I&#39;m certain of it. He had me put away. He and Dr. Grantland made Mildred sign the commitment papers. Once I was there, he cut me off entirely. He wouldn&#39;t visit me. He made them censor my mail so I couldn&#39;t even write letters.&#34; The words had been rushing faster and faster, tumbling out of his mouth. He paused and gulped. His Adam&#39;s apple bobbed like a ball valve under the skin of his throat.&#34;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like being cut off like that, not knowing what goes on. Of course, Mildred came to see me, every chance she got, but she didn&#39;t know what it was all about, either. And we couldn&#39;t talk freely about family matters. They made her visit me on the ward, and they always kept a nurse there, within hearing. As if I couldn&#39;t be trusted with my own wife.&#34;&#34;Why, Carl? Were you violent?&#34;Suddenly and heavily, as if I&#39;d rabbit-punched him, his head sank low between his shoulders. I looked him over, thinking that he could be formidable in a violent mood. His shoulders were overlaid with laminated muscle, and wide enough to yoke a pair of oxen. He was saying:&#34;I made a fool of myself the first few days--tore up a couple of mattresses, things like that. They put me in wet packs. But I never hurt anyone. At least I don&#39;t remember, if I did.&#34; His voice had sunk almost out of hearing. He raised it, and lifted his head. &#34;Anyway, I never stepped out of line after that, not once. I wasn&#39;t going to give them any excuse to keep me locked up. But they did. And they had no right to.&#34;&#34;So you came over the wall.&#34;He looked at me in surprise, his pale eyes wide. &#34;How did you know we came over the wall?&#34;I didn&#39;t bother explaining that it was only an expression, which seemed to have hit the literal truth. &#34;More than one of you broke out, eh?&#34;He didn&#39;t answer. His eyes narrowed suspiciously, still watching my face.&#34;Where are the others, Carl?&#34;&#34;There&#39;s only the one other,&#34; he said haltingly. &#34;Who he is doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll read about it in the papers, anyway.&#34;&#34;Not necessarily. They don&#39;t publicize these things unless the escapees are dangerous.&#34;chapter 2I LET that last word hang in the silence, turning this way and that, a question and a threat and a request. Carl Hallman looked at the window over the sink, where morning shone unhampered. Sounds of sporadic traffic came from the street. He turned to look at the door he had come in by. His body was taut, and the cords in his neck stood out. His face was thoughtful.He got up suddenly, in a brusque movement which sent his chair over backwards, crossed in two strides to the door. I said sharply:&#34;Pick up the chair.&#34;He paused with his hand on the knob, tension vibrating through him. &#34;Don&#39;t give me orders. I don&#39;t take orders from you.&#34;&#34;It&#39;s a suggestion, boy.&#34;&#34;I&#39;m not a boy.&#34;&#34;To me you are. I&#39;m forty. How old are you?&#34;&#34;It&#39;s none of your--&#34; He paused, in conflict with himself. &#34;I&#39;m twenty-four.&#34;&#34;Act your age, then. Pick up the chair and sit down and we&#39;ll talk this over. You don&#39;t want to go on running.&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t intend to. I never wanted to. It&#39;s just--I have to get home and clean up the mess. Then I don&#39;t care what happens to me.&#34;&#34;You should. You&#39;re young. You have a wife, and a future.&#34;&#34;Mildred deserves someone better than me--than I. My future is in the past.&#34;But he turned from the door, from the bright and fearful morning on the other side of it, and picked up the chair and sat in it. I sat on the kitchen table, looking down at him. His tension had wrung sweat out of his body. It stood in droplets on his face, and darkened the front of his shirt. He said very youngly:&#34;You think I&#39;m crazy, don&#39;t you?&#34;&#34;What I think doesn&#39;t matter, I&#39;m not your headshrinker. But if you are, you need the hospital. If you&#39;re not, this is a hell of a way to prove you&#39;re not. You should go back and get yourself checked out.&#34;&#34;Go back? You must be cr--&#34; He caught himself.I laughed in his face, partly because I thought he was funny and partly because I thought he needed it. &#34;I must be crazy? Go ahead and say it. I&#39;m not proud. I&#39;ve got a friend in psychiatry who says they should build mental hospitals with hinged corners. Every now and then they should turn them inside out, so the people on the outside are in, and the people on the inside are out. I think he&#39;s got something.&#34;&#34;You&#39;re making fun of me.&#34;&#34;What if I am? It&#39;s a free country.&#34;&#34;Yes, it is a free country. And you can&#39;t make me go back there.&#34;&#34;I think you should. This way, you&#39;re headed for more trouble.&#34;&#34;I can&#39;t go back. They&#39;d never let me out, now.&#34;&#34;They will when you&#39;re ready. If you turn yourself in voluntarily, it shouldn&#39;t go against you very hard. When did you break out?&#34;&#34;Last night--early last evening, after supper. We didn&#39;t exactly break out. We piled the benches against the wall of the courtyard. I hoisted the other fellow up to the top and he helped me up after him, with a knotted sheet. We got away without being seen, I think. Tom--the other fellow--had a car waiting. They gave me a ride part of the way. I walked the rest.&#34;&#34;Do you have a special doctor you can see, if you go back?&#34;&#34;Doctor!&#34; It was a dirty word in his vocabulary. &#34;I&#39;ve seen too many doctors. They&#39;re all a bunch of shysters, and Dr. Grantland is the worst of them. He shouldn&#39;t even be allowed to practice.&#34;&#34;Okay, we&#39;ll take away his license.&#34;He looked up, startled. He was easy to startle. Then anger rose in him. &#34;You don&#39;t take me seriously. I came to you for help in a serious matter, and all I get is cheap wisecracks. It makes me mad.&#34;&#34;All right. It&#39;s a free country.&#34;&#34;God damn you.&#34;I let that pass. He sat with his head down for several minutes, holding himself still. Finally he said: &#34;My father was Senator Hallman of Purissima. Does the name mean anything to you?&#34;&#34;I read in the papers that he died last spring.&#34;He nodded jerkily. &#34;They locked me up the next day, and wouldn&#39;t even let me go to his funeral. I know I blew my top, but they had no right to do that. They did it because they didn&#39;t want me snooping.&#34;&#34;Who are &#39;they&#39;?&#34;&#34;Jerry and Zinnie. Zinnie is my sister-in-law. She&#39;s always hated me, and Jerry&#39;s under her thumb. They want to keep me shut up for the rest of their lives, so that they can have the property to themselves.&#34;&#34;How do you know that?&#34;&#34;I&#39;ve had a lot of time to think. I&#39;ve been puffing things together for six months. When I got the word on Dr. Grantland-- Well, it&#39;s obvious they paid him to have me committed. They may even have paid him to kill Father.&#34;&#34;I thought your father&#39;s death was accidental.&#34;</p><h2>Reaper&#39;s Legacy (Reapers Motorcycle Club)</h2><p>Eight years ago, Sophie gave her heart&#x2014;and her virginity&#x2014;to Zach Barrett on a night that couldn&#x2019;t have been less romantic or more embarrassing. Zach&#x2019;s step-brother, a steely-muscled, tattooed biker named Ruger, caught them in the act, getting a peep show of Sophie he&#x2019;s never forgotten.<br><br>She may have lost her dignity that fateful night, but Sophie also gained something precious&#x2014;her son Noah. Unfortunately, Zach&#x2019;s a deadbeat dad, leaving Ruger to be Noah&#x2019;s only male role model. When he discovers Sophie and his nephew living in near poverty, Ruger takes matters into his own hands&#x2014;with the help of the Reapers Motorcycle Club&#x2014;to give them a better life.<br><br>Living with outlaw bikers wasn&#x2019;t Sophie&#x2019;s plan for her son, but Ruger isn&#x2019;t giving her a choice. He&#x2019;ll be there for Noah, whether she wants him or not. But Sophie&nbsp;<i>does</i>&nbsp;want him, has always wanted him. Now she&#x2019;ll learn that taking a biker to bed can get a girl dirty in every way...</p><p><b>Joanna Wylde </b>has written several erotic romances for Ellora's Cave and lives in Idaho.<b>Seven years later</b><p><b>Seattle, Washington</b></p><p><b>Sophie</b></p><p>Our last night in Seattle didn&#x2019;t go so great.</p><p>My babysitter, my emergency backup sitter, and my second emergency backup sitter all had the flu. I&#x2019;d have been screwed if one of my new neighbors hadn&#x2019;t volunteered to keep an eye on Noah. I didn&#x2019;t really know her, but we&#x2019;d been living next to each other for a month and no red flags. Not the best, I know.</p><p>You do what you have to when you&#x2019;re a single mom.</p><p>Then Dick yelled at me for coming in late for my shift.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t tell him I&#x2019;d nearly missed work altogether because of Noah. And no, I&#x2019;m not just calling him Dick because he&#x2019;s actually a dick (although he is). It&#x2019;s his real name.</p><p>That night I actually understood why he was in such a bad mood, because of the six girls who were supposed to be on, only two showed. Two had the flu (genuine&#x2014;half the city had it) and two had dates. Or I&#x2019;m assuming they had dates. Their official stories were a dead grandmother (her fifth) and an infected tattoo.</p><p>Apparently none of the drug stores in her neighborhood carried Bacitracin.</p><p>Either way, things fell to shit fast. We had a band, which put the customers in a good mood, but the live music and drunken dancing made it even harder to keep up with my tables. Also made us busier than usual. We would&#x2019;ve been stretched even with a full staff. To make things perfect, it was a local band and most of their fans were college students, which meant crappy tips.</p><p>By eleven I was already tired and needed to pee in a bad way, so I ducked into the bathroom. Out of toilet paper already (of course), and I knew damned well nobody had time to restock. I pulled out my phone, doing a quick check for messages, and saw two. One from Miranda, my babysitter, and a second from Ruger, the world&#x2019;s scariest almost-in-law.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Miranda first. I held it to my ear and listened, hoping to hell everything was all right. No way Dick would let me off early, even for an emergency. Ruger could wait.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;m scared,&#x201d; Noah said.</p><p>I froze.</p><p>&#x201c;I took Miranda&#x2019;s phone and I&#x2019;m hiding in the closet,&#x201d; he continued. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a bad guy here and he&#x2019;s smoking inside and he wanted me to smoke, too, and they kept laughing at me. He tried to tickle me and make me sit on his lap. Now they&#x2019;re watching a movie that has naked people in it and I don&#x2019;t like it. I don&#x2019;t want to be here and I want to go home. I want you to come home. I really need you. Right now.&#x201d;</p><p>I heard his breath hitch, like he was crying but didn&#x2019;t want me to know, and then the message cut out.</p><p>I took a couple of deep breaths, trying to control my surge of adrenaline. I checked the time on the message&#x2014;almost forty-five minutes ago. My stomach twisted and for a second I thought I might puke. Then I pulled it together and left the bathroom. I managed to walk back into the bar and had Brett, the bartender, unlock the drawer where we kept our purses.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to get home, my kid&#x2019;s in trouble. Tell Dick.&#x201d;</p><p>With that I headed toward the door, pushing through drunken frat boys. I was almost out when someone grabbed my arm, spinning me around. My boss stood there, glaring.</p><p>&#x201c;Where the hell do you think you&#x2019;re going, Williams?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s an emergency,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;I need to go home.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You leave me now with a crowd like this, don&#x2019;t come back,&#x201d; Dick growled. I leaned forward and stared him down, which was pretty easy considering the guy was hardly more than five feet tall. On good days I thought of him as a hobbit.</p><p>Tonight he was just a troll.</p><p>&#x201c;I need to take care of my son,&#x201d; I said coldly, using my deadliest troll-killing voice. &#x201c;Let go of my arm. Now. I&#x2019;m leaving.&#x201d;</p><p>Driving home took at least a year.</p><p>I kept trying to call Miranda, but nobody answered. When I reached our ancient apartment building, I tore up the wooden stairs to the top floor, shaking with a weird mixture of rage and fear. Miranda&#x2019;s place was right across from my little studio, and while my thighs and calves hated the climb, I loved how we were the only residents up here. Until now.</p><p>Tonight it felt remote and scary.</p><p>I heard music and grunting as I pounded on the door. No answer. I pounded harder and wondered if I&#x2019;d have to break in. Then the door flew open. A tall guy with unbuttoned pants and no shirt blocked the entry. He had the start of a gut and bloodshot eyes. I smelled pot and booze.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; he asked, swaying. I tried looking around him, but he blocked me.</p><p>&#x201c;My son, Noah, is here,&#x201d; I said, struggling to stay calm and focus on what really counted. I could kill this asshole later. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to pick him up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah. Forgot about him. C&#x2019;mon in.&#x201d;</p><p>He stepped aside and I ducked past him. Miranda&#x2019;s place was a studio just like ours, so I should&#x2019;ve seen Noah right away. Instead I spotted my useless neighbor on the couch, collapsed on her back with her eyes glazed and a dreamy smile on her face. Her clothes were rumpled, her long hippie skirt shoved up above her splayed knees. The phone lay on the coffee table in front of her, next to a bong made out of plastic pens, foil and a Mountain Dew bottle. Empties surrounded it, because apparently weed wasn&#x2019;t enough to keep her entertained while she failed to babysit my seven-year-old child.</p><p>&#x201c;Miranda, where&#x2019;s Noah?&#x201d; I demanded. She looked at me blankly.</p><p>&#x201c;How should I know?&#x201d; she slurred.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe he went outside,&#x201d; the guy muttered, turning away from me as he reached into the fridge for another beer.</p><p>I caught my breath.</p><p>Across his back was a giant tattoo that looked kind of like Ruger&#x2019;s, only it said Devil&#x2019;s Jacks instead of Reapers. Motorcycle club. Bad news. Always bad, despite what Ruger insisted.</p><p>I&#x2019;d think about that later. Focus. I needed to find Noah.</p><p>&#x201c;Mama?&#x201d;</p><p>His voice was soft and trembling. I looked around frantically, then saw him climbing in through an open window facing the street. Oh my God. I moved toward him, forcing myself to approach oh-so-carefully. Four flights above the ground and my boy was clinging to a windowsill. If I wasn&#x2019;t damned careful, I&#x2019;d knock him off the ledge.</p><p>I reached out and clamped my hands around his upper arms, pulling him in and clutching him close. He wrapped around me like a little monkey. I rubbed my hand up and down his back, whispering how much I loved him and promising never to leave him alone like that again.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get what you&#x2019;re so upset about,&#x201d; Miranda muttered, pulling herself up to make room for her asshole boyfriend. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a fire escape out there and it&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s cold. It&#x2019;s August. Kid was fine.&#x201d;</p><p>I took a deep breath, closed my eyes and forced myself to stay calm. Then I opened them and looked past her.</p><p>That&#x2019;s when I saw the porn on the TV.</p><p>My eyes skittered away from the sight of a silicone woman screwing four guys simultaneously. Something terrible took fire in my heart.</p><p>Stupid bitch. Miranda would pay for this.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your problem, anyway?&#x201d; she slurred.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t bother answering. I just needed to get my boy out of here and home safe. I&#x2019;d deal with my neighbor tomorrow.</p><p>Maybe by then I&#x2019;d have calmed down enough not to end her miserable life.</p><p>I carried Noah out of the apartment and across the hallway to my own door. Somehow I managed to get it open without dropping him, fingers trembling from suppressed rage and a health dose of guilt.</p><p>I&#x2019;d failed him.</p><p>My baby needed me, and instead of protecting him, I&#x2019;d left him parked with a druggie who could&#x2019;ve gotten him killed. Being a single mom sucked.</p><p>It took a warm bath, an hour of snuggles, and four books to get Noah to sleep.</p><p>Me? I wasn&#x2019;t sure I&#x2019;d ever sleep again.</p><p>The summer heat didn&#x2019;t help&#x2014;I swear, the place had zero airflow. After an hour of sweating in the darkness, watching his little chest rise and fall, I gave up. I popped a beer and sat down on our couch, a thousand plans running through my head. First, I&#x2019;d kill Miranda. Then either I needed to find a new place to live or she did. I also pondered whether to call the cops.</p><p>I liked the idea of throwing her and her stoner boyfriend to the wolves. They deserved a friendly visit from the boys in blue.</p><p>But since her man was in a motorcycle club, calling the cops might not be the smartest move. Guys in MCs generally weren&#x2019;t fond of the police, a perspective he and his club brothers might feel the need to share with me once he made bail. Not to mention Child Protective Services would get involved, which could also get pretty ugly.</p><p>I loved Noah and would do anything for him. I was a damned good mother. When other girls my age were out partying and having fun, I was taking him to the park and reading him stories. I spent my twenty-first birthday holding him while he puked from stomach flu instead of hitting the bars. No matter how rough things got, I spent time with Noah every day and made sure he felt loved.</p><p>But I didn&#x2019;t look so good on paper.</p><p>Single mom. Dad out of the picture. No family around, crappy studio apartment. Probably unemployed after tonight . . . What would CPS make of that? Would they blame me for leaving him with Miranda in the first place?</p><p>I had no idea what to do. I took a long pull on the beer and then turned on my phone, where Ruger&#x2019;s message glowed at me accusingly. Crap. I hated calling him. No matter how much time he spent with us (and he made a point of seeing Noah regularly), I just couldn&#x2019;t relax around him. Ruger didn&#x2019;t like me and I knew it. I think he blamed me for destroying his relationship with Zach. God knows, I played my part. I pushed that memory away.</p><p>I always pushed that memory away.</p><p>If only I unnerved him, too, but apparently that was too much to ask. Instead he just looked right through me, hardly bothering to acknowledge my existence.</p><p>Even more frustrating? Ruger had to be the hottest guy I&#x2019;d ever met. He was all danger and hard muscles, with his tattoos and piercings and that goddamned black Harley of his. When he walked into a room he owned it, because it only took one look to see he was a fucking badass, the type who takes what he wants and never says he&#x2019;s sorry.</p><p>I&#x2019;d been nursing a hell of a crush on him for longer than I cared to acknowledge, something he&#x2019;d failed to notice despite his apparent fascination with every other woman under the age of forty within five hundred miles. Well, failed to notice all but once, and that hadn&#x2019;t exactly ended well.</p><p>At least he never brought any of his club whores around (which I greatly appreciated), but that didn&#x2019;t change the fact that he was one of the biggest sluts in north Idaho.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s where we stood.</p><p>Presented with my nonthreatening charms, the panhandle&#x2019;s sexiest, most prolific man-whore still preferred hanging with my seven-year-old child during his visits.</p><p>I sighed and hit the play button.</p><p>&#x201c;Sophie, answer your fucking phone,&#x201d; he said, his voice cold and unyielding, like usual. &#x201c;I just got a call from Noah. I talked to him for a while and tried to keep him calm, but then some bitch started yellin&#x2019; and took the phone away. Nobody answered when I called back. I don&#x2019;t know what the fuck you&#x2019;re thinking, but your kid needs you. Get off your ass and go get him. Now. I swear, if anything happens to him . . . You don&#x2019;t wanna go there, Sophie. Just fucking call me when you find him. No excuses.&#x201d;</p><p>I dropped the phone and leaned forward on my knees, rubbing my temples with the tips of my fingers.</p><p>In addition to everything else, now I had to deal with Mr. Being-A-Biker-Isn&#x2019;t-A-Crime losing his shit on me. Which he would do, I had no doubt. Ruger was scary enough in a good mood. The one time I&#x2019;d seen him truly enraged still gave me nightmares, and that&#x2019;s not a figure of speech. Unfortunately, he had a point. When my son needed me, I hadn&#x2019;t answered the phone. Thank God Ruger had been there for Noah. But still . . . I really didn&#x2019;t want to deal with him right now, either.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t leave him hanging, though, worried about Noah all night. He&#x2019;d called me a bitch the last time I saw him, and maybe he had a point, but I wasn&#x2019;t a big enough bitch to torture him like that. I hit the callback button.</p><p>&#x201c;He all right?&#x201d; Ruger demanded, not bothering with a hello.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got him and he&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t hear the phone ring at work, but I found his message and left about forty-five minutes later. He&#x2019;s okay. We got lucky and nothing happened, not that I can tell.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You sure that asshole didn&#x2019;t touch him?&#x201d; Ruger asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Noah said he tried to tickle him and make him sit on his lap, but he ran away. They were completely cross-faded. I don&#x2019;t think they even noticed when he took off. He was hiding outside on the fire escape.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fuck . . .&#x201d; Ruger said. He didn&#x2019;t sound happy. &#x201c;How high up was he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Four stories,&#x201d; I said, closing my eyes in shame. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a miracle he didn&#x2019;t fall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, I&#x2019;m driving. I&#x2019;ll talk to you later. Don&#x2019;t fucking leave him alone again, or you&#x2019;ll answer to me. You got that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I whispered. I hung up the phone and set it down on the table. The room felt stifling and I couldn&#x2019;t get enough air, so I crept softly across the floor to the window. The splintery wooden sash slid up with a groan and I leaned out, looking down at the street, sucking in the cool breeze. The bars had just emptied and people laughed outside, walking along like everything was fine and dandy.</p><p>What if I hadn&#x2019;t checked the voice mail? Would any of these happy drunks have looked up and seen a little boy clinging to the fire escape? What if he&#x2019;d fallen asleep out there?</p><p>Noah could be dead on that pavement right now.</p><p>I finished my beer and grabbed a second one, then sat on my ratty couch and pounded it. The last time I checked the clock, it said three a.m.</p></p><h2>Children and the Tundra</h2><p><p><b>The fifth volume in the ludicrously misinformative <i>HOW</i> Series.</b><br><br>For many years the scientific and educational community has wondered and worried about the possibility that semi-sane scholar pretenders would find the means to put out a series of reference books aimed at children but filled with ludicrous misinformation. These books would be distributed through respectable channels and would inevitably find their way into the hands and households of well-meaning families, who would go to them for facts but instead find bizarre untruths. The books would look normal enough, but would read as if written by people who should at all costs be denied access to pens and pencils.<br><br>Sadly, with the publication of this, the fifth volume in a proposed series of 377 reference books, that day has come. <i>Children and the Tundra</i> is actually two books in one, as Dr. Doris Haggis-on-Whey, due to space constraints, is forced to explain both the concept of children a species she doesn&#x2019;t trust for a second and the tundra, in one book. She is, as always, joined in her crusade of lies by her husband, Benny, who is mostly useless.<br></p></p><p><p><b>Dr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey</b> has 17 degrees from 18 institutions of higher learning. She is a world-renowned and much-feared expert on just about everything. With her husband Benny, she has travelled the world many times over, and has learned about all aspects of life, including outer space and food, first-hand. She has written or will soon write 147 books. <b>Benny</b> is the husband of Dr. Doris Haggis-On-Whey, and enjoys putting on his socks. The Haggis-On-Wheys live everywhere.</p><p>Praise for <i>Children and the Tundra</i>:<br><br> In its tone and design, to say nothing of the sturdiness of its typefaces, Haggis-on-Whey nails the authoritarian aesthetic of 1950s textbooks. Most important, it is very, very silly.&#x201d; <i>The Paris Review</i><br></p></p><h2>Sins of a Wicked Duke (The Penwich School for Virtuous Girls, 1)</h2><p><p>She works to live . . .</p><p>One would think the last place a beauty like Fallon O'Rourke could keep her virtue was in the Mayfair mansion of London's most licentious duke, the notorious Dominic Hale. Yet Fallon&#x2014;who's endured nothing but lecherous advances since her father's tragic death&#x2014;is perfectly safe there . . . disguised as a footman! Beneath the notice of the dark-haired devil with his smoldering blue eyes and sinful smile, Fallon never imagines her secret will be discovered. But how long can her deception last when she begins to wish she is one of the many women traipsing in and out of the sinful rogue's bedchamber?</p><p>He lives to sin . . .</p><p>Most men envy the duke, never suspecting his pleasure-loving ways are a desperate attempt to escape, however briefly, the pain of a past that's left him with a heart of stone. Only one woman can break down his defenses. Only one woman can win his love . . . if she reveals her secret and succumbs to the sins of the wicked duke.</p></p><p><p>Sophie Jordan grew up on a pecan farm in the Texas hill country, where she wove fantasies of dragons, warriors, and princesses. A former high school English teacher, she's also the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of Avon historical romances and the Firelight series. She now lives in Houston with her family. When she's not writing, she spends her time overloading on caffeine (lattes and Diet cherry Coke preferred), talking plotlines with anyone who will listen (including her kids), and cramming her DVR with true-crime and reality-TV shows.</p>A beautiful working-class girl finds true love with a licentious rake in the promising opening of a new Regency romance series. Orphaned heroine Fallon O'Rourke is one of a trio of resourceful young women who have moved from the Penwich School for Virtuous Girls into household service to the <i>ton</i>. Fallon dodges several lecherous employers and finally finds safety in male disguise as a footman, working for the notoriously decadent Dominic Hale. As Fallon fights her growing desire for her new boss and Dominic puzzles over his unusual interest in his young employee, their growing closeness endangers both Fallon's secret and her virtue. Jordan (<i>Surrender to Me</i>) only sketches the Regency setting, keeping a tight focus on Dominic's household, but sizzling sexual tension between the leads makes for a thoroughly satisfying romantic romp. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now Halley&#39;s quest for answers will push him to his very limits-both on and off the track.</p><p>Dick Francis (pictured with his son Felix Francis) was born in South Wales in 1920. He was a young rider of distinction winning awards and trophies at horse shows throughout the United Kingdom. At the outbreak of World War II he joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot, flying fighter and bomber aircraft including the Spitfire and Lancaster.<p>He became one of the most successful postwar steeplechase jockeys, winning more than 350 races and riding for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. After his retirement from the saddle in 1957, he published an autobiography, <i>The Sport of Queens</i>, before going on to write more than forty acclaimed books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Even Money</i> and <i>Silks</i>. </p><p>A three-time Edgar Award winner, he also received the prestigious Crime Writers&#x2019; Association&#x2019;s Cartier Diamond Dagger, was named Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, and was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#x2019;s Birthday Honours List in 2000. He died in February 2010, at age eighty-nine, and remains among the greatest thriller writers of all time.</p>Dick Francis reacquaints listeners with champion-jockey-turned-sleuth Sid Halley, featured in earlier mysteries of the British racing circuit. The Cheltenham Gold Cup Race has more excitement than usual when a jockey is murdered. As Sid begins his sleuthing, one notices a change in tempo from the usual style of this author. Much of the change is due to the bravura reading of Martin Jarvis, who carves out the characters and gives each of them a special voice and an expansively operatic mood to surround the moment. His performance and timing are specifically aimed at the listener's entertainment as he reads the words of an older, gentler Dick Francis, whose Sid Halley is still just 38.

Why did high-minded, cultured Catherine choose not to accompany her husband to a grand party on the night of her demise? Why did she dismiss all her servants for the evening and leave the front door unlocked? What had been her relationship with the young man seen frequently by her side at concerts and art exhibits? And what can be done to avenge another terrible crime: the assault on Angeles Castelbranco, beloved teenage daughter of the Portuguese ambassador?<br> &nbsp;<br> As an ordinary policeman, Pitt used to enter London&#x2019;s grand houses through the kitchen door. Now, as a guest in those same houses, can he find the steel in his soul to challenge the great men of the world with their crimes?

The light from the chandeliers sparkled on necklaces, bracelets, and earrings. Between the somber black and white suits of the men, the women&#x2019;s gowns blossomed in every color of the early summer: delicate pastels for the young, burning pinks and golds for those in the height of their beauty, and wines, mulberries, and lavenders for the more advanced.<br><br>Beside him was Charlotte, her hand resting lightly on his arm. She had no diamonds to wear, but he knew that she had long ago ceased to mind that. It was 1896 and she was now forty years old. The flush of youth had gone, but the richness of maturity became her even more. The happiness that glowed in her face was lovelier than flawless skin or sculpted features, which were mere gifts of chance.<br><br>Her hand tightened on his arm for a moment as they started down the stairs. Then they moved into the throng of people, smiling, acknowledging this one and that, trying to remember names. Pitt had recently been promoted to head of Britain&#x2019;s Special Branch, and it was a heavier weight of responsibility than he had ever carried before. There was no one senior to him in whom he could confide, or to whom he could defer a difficult decision.<br><br>He spoke now to ministers, ambassadors, people of influence far greater than their casual laughter in this room might suggest. Pitt had been born in the most modest of circumstances, and gatherings like this were still not easy for him. As a policeman, he had entered homes through the kitchen door, like any other servant, whereas now he was socially acceptable because of the power his position gave him and because he was privy to a range of secrets about almost everyone in the room.<br><br>Beside him Charlotte moved easily, and he watched her grace with pleasure. She had been born into Society and knew its foibles and its weaknesses, even if she was too disastrously candid to steer her way through them, unless it was absolutely necessary, as it was now.<br><br>She murmured some polite comment to the woman next to her, trying to look interested in the reply. Then she allowed herself to be introduced to Isaura Castelbranco, the wife of the Portuguese Ambassador to Britain.<br><br>&#x201c;How do you do, Mrs. Pitt?&#x201d; Isaura replied with warmth. She was a shorter woman than Charlotte, barely of average height, but the dignity of her bearing made her stand apart from the ordinary. Her features were gentle, almost vulnerable, and her eyes were so dark as to seem black against her pale skin.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you are finding our summer weather agreeable?&#x201d; Charlotte remarked, for the sake of something to say. No one cared about the subject: it was the tone of voice, the smile in the eyes, that mattered.<br><br>&#x201c;It is very pleasant not to be too hot,&#x201d; Isaura answered immediately. &#x201c;I am looking forward to the Regatta. It is at Henley, I believe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed it is,&#x201d; Charlotte agreed. &#x201c;I admit, I haven&#x2019;t been for years, but I would love to do so again.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt knew that was not really true. Charlotte found the chatter and the pretentiousness of lavish Society events a little tedious, but he could see in her face that she liked this woman with her quiet manner.<br><br>They spoke for several minutes more before courtesy required that they offer their attention to the others who swirled around under the lights, or drifted to the various side rooms, or down the stairs to the hallway below.<br><br>They separated with a smile as Pitt was drawn into conversation with a junior minister from the Foreign Office. Charlotte managed to catch the attention of her great-aunt, Lady Vespasia Cumming-Gould. Actually she was great-aunt by marriage to Charlotte&#x2019;s sister Emily, but over the years that distinction had ceased even to be remembered, let alone matter.<br><br>&#x201c;You seem to be enjoying yourself,&#x201d; Vespasia said softly, amusement lighting her remarkable silver-gray eyes. In her prime she had reputedly been the most beautiful woman in Europe, certainly the wittiest. Did they but know it, she was also one who had fought at the barricades in Rome, during the turbulent revolution that had swept Europe in &#x2019;48.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t forgotten all my manners,&#x201d; Charlotte replied with her usual frankness. &#x201c;I fear I am reaching an age when I cannot afford to wear an expression of boredom. It is terribly unflattering.&#x201d;<br><br>Vespasia was quite openly amused, her smile warm. &#x201c;It never does to look as if you are waiting for something,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;Which is good. Women who are waiting are so tiresome. Who have you met?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The wife of the Portuguese ambassador,&#x201d; Charlotte replied. &#x201c;I liked her immediately. There is something unusual in her face. I&#x2019;m sorry I shall probably never see her again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Isaura Castelbranco,&#x201d; Vespasia said thoughtfully. &#x201c;I know little of her, thank heaven. I know too much about so many other people. A little mystery lends such charm, like the softness of the late afternoon or the silence between the notes of music.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte was turning the thought over in her mind before replying when there was a sudden commotion a dozen yards away from them. Like those around her, she turned toward it. A very elegant young man with a sweep of fair hair took a step backward, raising his hands defensively, a look of disbelief on his face.<br><br>In front of him a girl in a gown of white lace stood alone, the skin of her bosom, neck and cheeks flushed red. She was very young, perhaps no more than sixteen, but of a Mediterranean darkness, and already the woman she would become was clear in the curves of her body.<br><br>Everyone around the two fell silent, either in embarrassment or possibly out of confusion, as if they had little idea what was happening.<br><br>&#x201c;Really, you are quite unreasonable,&#x201d; the young man said defensively, his voice light, trying to brush off the incident. &#x201c;You misunderstood me.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl was not soothed at all. She looked angry, even a little frightened.<br><br>&#x201c;No, sir,&#x201d; she said in slightly accented English. &#x201c;I did not misunderstand. Some things are the same in all languages.&#x201d;<br><br>He still did not seem to be perturbed, only elaborately patient, as with someone who was being unintentionally obtuse. &#x201c;I assure you, I meant it merely as a compliment. You must be used to such things?&#x201d;<br><br>She drew in her breath to answer, but obviously could not find the words she wished.<br><br>He smiled, now openly amused at her, perhaps just a little mocking. He was good-looking in an unusual way. He had a strong and prominent nose and thin lips, but fine dark eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to get used to admiration.&#x201d; His look swept up and down her with just a fraction too much candor. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll receive a great deal of it, I can promise you.&#x201d;<br><br>The girl was shaking now. Even from where she stood, Charlotte could see that she had no idea how to deal with such inappropriate appreciation of her beauty. She was too young to have learned the necessary composure. It seemed her mother was not close enough to have overheard the exchange, and the young man, whom she now recognized as Neville Forsbrook, was very confident. His father was one of London&#x2019;s foremost bankers and the family had wealth and status, and all the privilege that came with it. He was not used to being denied anything, most especially by a girl who was not even British.<br><br>Charlotte took a step forward, and felt Vespasia&#x2019;s hand on her arm, restraining her.<br><br>The color had drained out of the girl&#x2019;s face, leaving her ashen. &#x201c;Leave me alone!&#x201d; Her voice was shrill and a little too loud. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch me!&#x201d;<br><br>Neville Forsbrook laughed quite openly now. &#x201c;My dear young lady, you are being ridiculous, and making something of a spectacle of yourself. I&#x2019;m sure that is not what you wish.&#x201d; He was smiling, and he took a step toward her, one hand out in front of him, as if to soothe.<br><br>The girl swung her hand wildly in an arc, catching his arm with hers and knocking it aside roughly. She swiveled around to escape, lost her balance and almost fell against another young woman, who promptly screamed and flung herself into the arms of a startled young man close to her.<br><br>The girl managed to untangle herself and fled, sobbing now. Neville Forsbrook remained where he was with a half smile on his face, which quickly changed to a look of bewilderment. He shrugged and spread his hands, elegant and strong, but the shadow of a smile remained. Was it out of embarrassment, or was there still the faintest hint of mockery there? Charlotte wasn&#x2019;t sure.<br><br>Someone stepped forward and began a polite conversation about nothing in particular. Others joined in gratefully. After a few moments the hum of voices resumed, the rustle of skirts, distant music, the slight sound of feet moving on the polished floor. It was as if nothing had happened.<br><br>&#x201c;That was very ugly,&#x201d; Charlotte said to Vespasia as soon as she was certain they were not overheard. &#x201c;What an insensitive young man.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He must feel foolish,&#x201d; Vespasia replied with a touch of sympathy.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth was that all about?&#x201d; a dark-haired woman near them asked confusedly.<br><br>The elderly man with her shook his head. &#x201c;Young ladies tend to be rather excitable, my dear. I wouldn&#x2019;t worry about it. It&#x2019;s just some misunderstanding, no doubt.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who is she, anyway?&#x201d; the woman asked him, glancing at Charlotte also, in case she could shed light on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Angeles Castelbranco. Pretty young thing,&#x201d; the elderly man remarked, not really to anyone. &#x201c;Going to be a beautiful woman.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s hardly relevant, James!&#x201d; his wife snapped. &#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t know how to behave! Imagine her doing that at a dinner party!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite bad enough here, thank you,&#x201d; another woman joined in. The brilliance of her diamonds and the sheen on her lush green silks could not disguise the bitterness of her expression.<br><br>Charlotte was stung to the girl&#x2019;s defense. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you are right,&#x201d; she said, meeting the woman&#x2019;s eyes boldly. &#x201c;You must know far more about it than we do. All we saw was what appeared to be a rather self-assured young man quite clearly embarrassing a foreign ambassador&#x2019;s daughter. I have no idea what preceded it, or how it might more kindly have been handled.&#x201d;<br><br>Charlotte felt Vespasia&#x2019;s hand fall very lightly on her arm again, but she ignored it. She kept the fixed, inquiring smile on her face and did not lower her gaze.<br><br>The woman in green colored angrily. &#x201c;You give me too much credit, Mrs. . . . I&#x2019;m afraid I do not know your name . . .&#x201d; She left the denial hanging in the air, not so much a question as a dismissal. &#x201c;But of course I am well acquainted with Sir Pelham Forsbrook, and therefore his son, Neville, who has been kind enough to show a very flattering interest in my youngest daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt now rejoined them with a glance at Vespasia, but Charlotte did not introduce either him or herself to the woman in green. &#x201c;Let us hope it is more graciously expressed than his unflattering interest in Miss Castelbranco,&#x201d; she continued in a tone so sweet as to be sickly. &#x201c;But of course you will make sure of that. You are not in a foreign country and uncertain how to deal with ambiguous remarks from young men directed toward your daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do not know any young men who make ambiguous remarks!&#x201d; the woman snapped back, her eyebrows arched high.<br><br>&#x201c;How pleasant for you,&#x201d; Charlotte murmured.<br><br>The elderly man coughed, and raised his handkerchief to conceal his mouth, his eyes dancing.<br><br>Pitt turned his head away as if he had heard some sudden noise to attract his attention, and accidentally pulled Charlotte with him, although in truth she was perfectly ready to leave. That had been her parting shot. From here on it could only get worse. She gave a dazzling smile to Vespasia, and saw an answering sparkle in her eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;What on earth are you doing?&#x201d; Pitt demanded softly as soon as they were out of earshot.<br><br>&#x201c;Telling her she&#x2019;s a fool,&#x201d; Charlotte replied. She had thought her meaning was obvious.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that!&#x201d; he retorted. &#x201c;And so does she. You have just made an enemy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she apologized. &#x201c;That may be unfortunate, but being her friend would have been even more so. She&#x2019;s a social climber of the worst sort.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do you know? Who is she?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I know because I&#x2019;ve just seen how she acts. And I have no idea who she is, nor do I care.&#x201d; She knew she might regret saying that, but just at the moment she was too angry to curb her temper. &#x201c;I am going to speak to Senhora Castelbranco and make sure her daughter is all right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Charlotte . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She broke free, turned for a moment and gave him the same dazzling smile she had offered Vespasia, then moved into the crowd toward where she had last seen the Portuguese ambassador&#x2019;s wife.<br><br>It took her ten minutes more to find her. Senhora Castelbranco was standing near one of the doorways, her daughter with her. The girl was the same height as her mother, and even prettier than she had appeared at a distance. Her eyes were dazzling, and her skin softly honey-colored with a faint flush across her cheeks. She watched Charlotte approach them with an alarm that she could not hide, even though she was clearly trying to.<br><br>Charlotte smiled at her briefly, then turned to her mother. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry that wretched young man was rude. It must be impossibly difficult for you to do anything, in your diplomatic position. It really was inexcusable of him.&#x201d; She turned to the girl, then realized she was uncertain how fluent her English might be. &#x201c;I hope you are all right?&#x201d; she said a little awkwardly. &#x201c;I apologize. We should have made sure you were not placed in such an ugly situation.&#x201d;<br><br>Angeles smiled, but her eyes filled with tears. &#x201c;Oh, I am quite all right, madam, I assure you. I . . . I am not hurt. I . . .&#x201d; She gulped. &#x201c;I just did not know how to answer him.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaura put a protective arm around her daughter&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;She is well, of course. Just a little embarrassed. In our own language she would&#x2019;ve known what to say.&#x201d; She gave a little shrug. &#x201c;In English one is not always sure if one is being amusing, or perhaps insulting. It is better not to speak than risk saying something one cannot later withdraw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Charlotte said, although she felt uneasy. It seemed like Angeles had actually been far more distressed than they were admitting. &#x201c;The more awkward the situation, the harder it is to find the words in another language,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;That is why he should have known better than to behave as he did. I am so sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>Isaura smiled at her, her dark eyes unreadable. &#x201c;You are very kind, but I assure you there is no harm done beyond a few moments&#x2019; unpleasantness. That is unavoidable in life. It happens to all of us at some time or another. The Season is full of events. I hope we will meet again.&#x201d;<br><br>It was gracious, but it was also a dismissal, as if they wished to be left alone for a while, perhaps even to leave.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope so too,&#x201d; Charlotte agreed, and excused herself.

Marco is young, handsome and well-educated. Not to mention he is one of the powerful Medici family&#x2019;s favored circle. </p><p> Even before her marriage with Marco is set, Simonetta is swept up into Lorenzo and Giuliano de&#x2019; Medici&#x2019;s glittering circle of politicians, poets, artists, and philosophers. The men of Florence&#x2015;most notably the rakish Giuliano de&#x2019; Medici&#x2015;become enthralled with her beauty. That she is educated and an ardent reader of poetry makes her more desirable and fashionable still. But it is her acquaintance with a young painter, Sandro Botticelli, which strikes her heart most. Botticelli immediately invites Simonetta, newly proclaimed the most beautiful woman in Florence, to pose for him. As Simonetta learns to navigate her marriage, her place in Florentine society, and the politics of beauty and desire, she and Botticelli develop a passionate intimacy, one that leads to her immortalization in his masterpiece, <i>The Birth of Venus.</i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Alyssa Palombo&#x2019;s <i>The Most Beautiful Woman in Florence</i> vividly captures the dangerous allure of the artist and muse bond with candor and unforgettable passion.</p></p><p>ALYSSA PALOMBO is the authorof <i>The Violinist of Venice </i>and<i> The Most Beautiful Woman in Florence</i>.She has published short fiction pieces in <i>BlackLantern Magazine </i>and<i> The Great LakesReview</i>.

I was up there a couple months earlier, but standing at sea level in the sticky heat with the twins, it seemed like a century ago.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The only animals on Everest are yaks and birds.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Because there&#x2019;s no food except for camp garbage.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Snow leopards don&#x2019;t eat garbage,&#x201d; Paula said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Birds do,&#x201d; Patrice insisted.<br> &nbsp;<br> Patrice was right. The birds also picked at the frozen corpses at the higher altitudes, but I didn&#x2019;t tell them this.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What do they call snow leopards in Tibet?&#x201d; Paula asks.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tried to remember. I hadn&#x2019;t picked up much Tibetan or Nepalese on Everest, but it seemed like one of the other climbers called it . . .<br> &nbsp;<br> The twins&#x2019; smartphones started playing Chopin&#x2019;s polonaise Op. 53 in A-flat major. The only reason I knew the piece was that they had been practicing it for at least a year. I&#x2019;d heard the music so many times, I thought I might be able to play it on the piano myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Texts!&#x201d; they shouted in unison, reaching into their pockets.<br> &nbsp;<br> That would be <i>one</i> text from either my mom or stepdad. They always text all of us so no one feels left out. Somewhere my smartphone was buzzing too, or maybe not, because I hadn&#x2019;t charged it in a week. In fact, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly sure where I had left the phone. Probably in my bedroom, or maybe in the kitchen. Drove my parents nuts. They couldn&#x2019;t threaten to take it away from me, because I didn&#x2019;t want it in the first place. I understand the idea of smartphones, but I think smartphones look dumb.<br> &nbsp;<br> Almost everyone in front of the snow leopard cage was holding a smartphone&#x2014;talking, listening to music, snapping photos, thumbing texts, tweeting, whatever. I&#x2019;d rather hold the twins&#x2019; hands than a smartphone.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mom,&#x201d; Patrice said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She wants us to go to the bookstore,&#x201d; Paula chimed in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mom co-owns a small bookstore with a friend.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Shen!</i>&#x201d; I shouted.<br> &nbsp;<br> The twins&#x2019; eyes went wide. The crowd stared at me.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Shen</i>,&#x201d; I repeated, more quietly. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they call the snow leopard in Tibet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Itch</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Mom&#x2019;s bookstore is called the Summit Bookshop&#x2014;not surprising, as she was a world-class climber before I was born. But the shop carries very few titles about climbing or mountaineering, and those it does carry are written by climbers she knows personally, including my bio dad, Joshua Wood, whom I rarely see and, to be truthful, don&#x2019;t miss much.<br> &nbsp;<br> The store was doing okay, considering most people are reading their books on electronic gizmos now. It stays in business because of Mom&#x2019;s taste in books.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Mom stopped climbing, she started reading&#x2014;everything. No TV or video games for me, the twins, or Rolf. We spend our spare time with words and music. Oh, and climbing&#x2014;at least in my case, but not so much since I came down from Everest. Instead, I&#x2019;d been hanging with the twins, which saved them from hanging out in the bookstore all day. We&#x2019;d been going to museums, plays, concerts, and movies almost every day.<br> &nbsp;<br> So far I hadn&#x2019;t gotten the itch to climb, but I knew it was coming. It was just a matter of time.<br> &nbsp;<br> We left the zoo, walked up Fifth, took a right on East Sixty-Sixth, then walked into the air-conditioned Summit Bookshop. It was jammed with people getting out of the heat. Mostly nannies. On weekday afternoons, the place looks like a daycare center. Mom has a little coffee shop in the corner of the store and makes more money selling coffee and pastries than she makes selling books.<br> &nbsp;<br> The nannies sipped iced lattes, chattering in several languages over their cooing babies and crying tots, talking about their real children, who lived long subway rides from where we lived. The twins ran over to the strollers and started making baby noises in perfect harmony.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mom came out of the back room carrying an armload of books with a padded envelope balanced on top. &#x201c;How was the zoo?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hot, but we were having a good time. What did you need the twins for?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t need the twins. I needed you. And knowing you wouldn&#x2019;t have your phone, I used them as intermediaries. I wish you&#x2019;d carry your phone.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; She set the books down and handed me the envelope.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Vincent dropped it by.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Vincent is my literary mentor, a.k.a. English teacher, at the Greene Street School. The school is filled with little geniuses like the twins. Then there&#x2019;s me. Everyone there has to have some kind of special talent. It was decided, without asking me, that I was the school&#x2019;s writer. To pass to the next grade, I had to write about my experiences on Everest in a couple of Moleskine journals.<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew what was in the envelope without opening it. I&#x2019;d carried Moleskine journals to the summit of the highest mountain on earth&#x2014;well, almost to the summit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are you going to open it?&#x201d; Mom asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> I tore the envelope open. Two Moleskine journals. Blank. Big surprise. There was a yellow sticky note on the cover of one of the journals in Vincent&#x2019;s careful printing.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Write something in First Person Present Tense. V.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Looks like Vincent has an assignment for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I already completed his assignment on Everest,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;And school doesn&#x2019;t start for more than a month.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note to Vincent: First person present tense is a ridiculous viewpoint. To start with, it&#x2019;s unbelievable. You&#x2019;re writing as if what is happening to you at that very moment is actually happening right then, but the reader knows that&#x2019;s not true. How can something be happening to you while you&#x2019;re writing about it in a journal? And don&#x2019;t tell me that the writer is merely transcribing what happened in real time. FPPT is a literary trick, but I&#x2019;ve used some of it in this journal, so you&#x2019;ll know that I can do it. And I can&#x2019;t believe that you dropped off an assignment a month before school starts. What&#x2019;s the matter with you?)</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t hurt you to keep your writing brain working until school begins,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a good writer.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t a good writer. Yet.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Writing is no different from piano,&#x201d; Mom continued. &#x201c;You have to practice to be good at it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Except when you&#x2019;re practicing piano, you&#x2019;re not writing the music&#x2014;you&#x2019;re playing other people&#x2019;s scores. When you write, you need to have something to write about.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll figure something out. But Vincent&#x2019;s assignment is not why I pulled you from the zoo. You have some old friends waiting for you in my office.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Go see for yourself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> JR, Will, and Jack. We&#x2019;d been on Everest together.<br> &nbsp;<br> With them was another guy I didn&#x2019;t know. They were gathered in front of Mom&#x2019;s climbing wall. The wall is covered with beautiful photos of her in her former climbing days, clinging and dangling at impossible inverted angles on sheer rock walls along with my real father, Joshua Wood.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She was called the Fly,&#x201d; I said as I walked into the room.<br> &nbsp;<br> They all turned around.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;She&#x2019;s incredible,&#x201d; JR said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s great to see you, Peak.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was great to see them, too. We shook hands.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This is Ethan Todd,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;The newest member of our team.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ethan gave me an engaging grin. The name sounded familiar, but I couldn&#x2019;t remember where I&#x2019;d heard it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Ethan is our new tech guy and climbing guru,&#x201d; Will explained.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re Ethan &#x2018;Sarge&#x2019; Todd. You topped McKinley and rode a snowboard down to the bottom.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Guilty.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At the bottom you were chased by a wolf.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was a young wolf, and he, or she, wasn&#x2019;t serious&#x2014;just curious.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why do they call you Sarge?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Long, boring story.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I liked Ethan, and I was happy to see JR, Will, and Jack. My bio dad had hired them to film me summiting Everest, which hadn&#x2019;t worked out the way my dad, or the film crew, had planned.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What brings you into town?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A couple things,&#x201d; JR answered. &#x201c;We finished the Everest documentary and signed a distribution deal with ESPN. It airs next month.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I look forward to seeing it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It came out pretty well. You&#x2019;re in it of course.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I wasn&#x2019;t happy to hear that I was in it, but I wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Originally the documentary was supposed to be about me&#x2014;<i>the youngest person to summit Everest</i>&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t happen. I stopped ten feet from the top and videotaped my friend Sun-jo becoming <i>the youngest person to summit Everest</i>&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s another story. It&#x2019;s just as well that it wasn&#x2019;t me. I&#x2019;d watched some of the tape of JR interviewing me. Awkward is the kindest thing I could say about it. Sun-jo had been much better on camera. &#x201c;A natural,&#x201d; as JR put it when we were filming on the mountain.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Remember Sun-jo&#x2019;s interview with the avalanche hurtling down behind him?&#x201d; Will asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t really an avalanche. The rocks were tumbling, not hurtling.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Dynamite vid!&#x201d; Jack said.<br> &nbsp;<br> I wondered what they were doing at the store. It wasn&#x2019;t like ESPN was across the street. They had to have taken a cab or a subway. They didn&#x2019;t walk. Not in this heat.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I appreciate you dropping by,&#x201d; I said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t just to say hello,&#x201d; JR admitted. &#x201c;We have a proposition for you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An invitation,&#x201d; Ethan said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;An opportunity,&#x201d; Jack added.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have another gig,&#x201d; JR said. &#x201c;Are you interested in a little climb?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Is my dad involved?&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t care if he was. I was just curious.<br> &nbsp;<br> JR shook his head. &#x201c;Have you heard of the Peace Climb?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cause Climbs. There are dozens of them every weekend all over the world. Climb for Cancer, Climb for Creatures, Climb for Love, Climb for God, Climb for Whatever, advertised in the back of all the climbing magazines. I&#x2019;m not against causes, but I prefer to climb alone if possible.<br> &nbsp;<br> I told them I didn&#x2019;t know anything about it.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Do you know who Sebastian Plank is?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Sebastian Plank was the richest man in the world, or so it was said. He had his digital fingerprint in a dozen billion-dollar high-tech businesses. Rolf was one of the two-hundred or so attorneys he had on retainer. Our loft was probably paid for by Plank, even though&#x2014;as far as I knew&#x2014;Rolf had never met him.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Plank is sponsoring the climb,&#x201d; JR said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Paying for the whole thing,&#x201d; Ethan added. &#x201c;First class all the way. Private jets, catered food, the best climbing gear money can buy.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;d always wondered about this worthy cause travel deal. My parents had a lot of friends who spent their free time and money traveling around the world to third world countries for a week or two at a time, planting food, digging ditches, and building houses. It seemed to me that the people they were trying to help might be better off with the cash their friends spent to travel there. Mom says I&#x2019;m too cynical. She&#x2019;s probably right.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How many climbers?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Two hundred plus,&#x201d; JR answered. &#x201c;All under eighteen.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From every country on earth,&#x201d; Ethan said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Not quite every country.&#x201d; Jack started counting off the excluded countries on his fingers. &#x201c;North Korea, Somalia, Papua New Gu&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Okay, okay. Most countries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It didn&#x2019;t matter how many countries were represented, because I wasn&#x2019;t really interested in climbing with two hundred plus, or even two, people.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I appreciate the invite, but it doesn&#x2019;t sound like my kind of thing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Surprise and disappointment spread across JR&#x2019;s...</p><h2>Resurrection: The Struggle for a New Russia</h2><p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author David Remnick chronicles the new Russia that emerged from the ash heap of the Soviet Union. From the siege of Parliament to the farcically tilted elections of 1996, from the rubble of Grozny to the grandiose wealth and naked corruption of today's Moscow, Remnick chronicles a society so racked by change that its citizens must daily ask themselves who they are, where they belong, and what they believe in. Remnick composes this panorama out of dozens of finely realized individual portraits. Here is Mikhail Gorbachev, his head still swimming from his plunge from reverence to ridicule. Here is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the half-Jewish anti-Semite who conducts politics as loony performance art. And here is Boris Yeltsin, the tottering populist who is not above stealing elections. In <b>Resurrection</b>, they become the players in a drama so vast and moving that it deserves comparison with the best reportage of George Orwell and Michael Herr.<br>"This is what happens when a good writer unleashes eye and ear on a story that moves with the speed of light. <b>Resurrection</b> has the feel of describing vast, historical change even as it is happening."--Chicago Tribune</p><p>In his first account of Russia, <i>Lenin's Tomb,</i> David Remnick wrote a history paced like a thriller that recast the common understanding of the last days of the Soviet Empire. While most reporters mouthed the standard lines about the "fall of communism," Remnick delivered a gripping account of how the old order in which gangsters ruled through brutal state power lost its hold on the Russian people. Remnick's stunning reportage cut away the myths of the Soviet system to provide the first account of how Eastern Europeans and former citizens of the Soviet Union had long viewed the Soviet regime. The book won the young author his first Pulitzer Prize. <p> In his new and equally superb book <i>Resurrection</i>, Remnick offers clear-eyed commentary on how the old order of gangsters has given way to a new order. Russia's power elite, he tells us, has embraced the tools and techniques of markets and electioneering to maintain power, while organized crime is fast becoming a major force in the economy. Remnick also describes how the changes in Russia have effected the people themselves. Heart-wrenching chapters on the war in Chechnya, the health and welfare of children (only 15 percent of school children are classified as healthy, and 50 percent are unfit for military service), and the diminished state of Russian letters and literature chronicle the suffering of a once proud nation as it attempts to rebuild itself. <i>Resurrection</i> makes good on Remnick's name and reputation as the best American writer on Russia today.</p><b>DAVID REMNICK</b> is the editor of <i>The New Yorker</i>. He began his career as a sportswriter for <i>The Washington Post</i> and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1994 for <i>Lenin's Tomb</i>. He is also the author of <i>Resurrection and The Devil Problem</i> and <i>Other True Stories</i>, a collection of essays.&nbsp;Mr. Remnick served as an Olympic Correspondent and Commentator for NBC during the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. He lives in New York City with his wife and three children.</p><h2>Reading the OED: One Man, One Year, 21,730 Pages</h2><p>An obsessive word lover's account of reading the entire <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, hailed as "the <i>Super Size Me</i> of lexicography."<br><br>"I'm reading the <i>OED</i> so you don't have to," says Ammon Shea on his slightly masochistic journey to scale the word lover's Mount Everest: the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>. In 26 chapters filled with sharp wit, sheer delight, and a documentarian's keen eye, Shea shares his year inside the <i>OED</i>, delivering a hair-pulling, eye-crossing account of reading every word.</p><p>Ammon Shea is the author of two previous books on obscure words, <i>Depraved English</i> and <i>Insulting English</i> (written with Peter Novobatzky). He read his first dictionary, <i>Merriam Webster&#x2019;s Second International</i>, ten years ago, and followed it up with the sequel, <i>Webster&#x2019;s Third International</i>. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.Shea&#x2019;s&nbsp;engougement (&#x201c;irrational fondness&#x201d;) for dictionaries led him to spend a year reading through all 20 volumes of the Oxford English Dictionary, and he describes this account as &#x201c;the thinking man&#x2019;s Cliff Notes to the greatest dictionary in the world.&#x201d; For each letter of the alphabet he&nbsp; provides a handful of his favorite words and his own humorous glosses, along with&nbsp;musings on&nbsp;the history of the OED, dictionaries in general, and his&nbsp;reading life. (He does most of his OED reading at the Hunter College Library and finds himself turning into one of those &#x201c;Library People&#x201d; as the year goes by.)&nbsp;He shares a number of words that, though they have fallen out of the common vocabulary,&nbsp;could be put to excellent use today: empleomania: &#x201c;a manic compulsion to hold public office&#x201d;; zabernism: &#x201c;a misuse of military authority.&#x201d;&nbsp;The book will happify (&#x201c;make happy&#x201d;) word and dictionary lovers, who will be able to&nbsp;read it in an hour or two, much less time than it takes to read the OED. --Mary Ellen Quinn</p><h2>Music Theory and Arranging Techniques for Folk Harps</h2><p>(Harp).

In his tales of the supernatural, he creates frighteningly believable, spine-tingling stories of prophetic dreams and visions, as well as more fantastical adventures with goblins and apparitions. Impressionistic sketches combine imaginatively heightened travel journals with wry observations of home and abroad, while in his dramatic monologues, Dickens demonstrates his talent for exploring the secret workings of the human mind. These short works display Dickens's exuberant sense of comedy and character as his imagination is given free rein.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He died in Kent on June 9, 1870. The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation,but also the horror of the infamous debtors&#x2019; prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and &#x201c;slave&#x201d; factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years&#x2019; formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney&#x2019;s clerk and newspaper reporter until his <i>Sketches by Boz</i> (1836) and <i>The Pickwick Papers</i> (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.</p><h2>Prints and Printmaking: An Introduction to the History and Techniques</h2><p>A print is a pictorial image that has been produced by a process that enables it to be multiplied, and many of the best-known works by some of the world's greatest artists are prints.

Lauren Greutman knows how that feels. For years, she struggled with too many bills to pay and not enough money to pay them. When Lauren found herself drowning in debt, she finally faced her extreme spending habits and took action.<br><br> In THE RECOVERING SPENDER, Lauren shares her story and offers advice that is based on the many strategies she developed to change her own life and bring her family budget back to black. Lauren shows her readers, step-by-step, how to get rid of bad money habits, pay down debt, and stay within a budget.<br><br> Some of the action chapters in the book are:<br><ul><li>Take an Inventory of Your Spending</li><li>Declutter Your Finances</li><li>Do an Expense Audit</li><li>Curb Your Spending and Define Your Values</li></ul><br><br> Lauren exchanged the overrated, stressed-out American dream for a new one-a happier life filled with family, friends, and financial freedom-and now you can do the same!</p><p>Since early 2010, Lauren Greutman<i>&nbsp;</i>has been a go-to resource for busy moms who are sick of keeping up with the Joneses and ready to learn a better way spend with their heart, stay true to their values, and live the lifestyle they want.<br>Here's why Lauren is the right person to help you achieve the financial freedom you deserve. Not so long ago, her husband, Mark, and her were living the American Dream. On the surface we had it all. Custom home, luxury cars, beautiful babies, and all the bells and whistles that credit cards, bank loans, and money could buy. Underneath, though, was a different story. &nbsp;I talk all about this in my book&nbsp;The Recovering Spender.<br>They were so consumed with keeping up appearances that before they knew it they had a mortgage underwater, a car towed away, were $40K in debt, running a deficit every month and finding it hard to buy diapers and groceries without using credit cards.&nbsp;<br>In the end, it was the connection between money and heart that really brought it all together for them.

But during World War II, Nazis used the star to segregate and terrorize the Jewish people. Except in Denmark. When Nazi soldiers occupied his country, King Christian X of Denmark committed himself to keeping all Danes safe from harm, and the bravery of the Danes and their king during that dangerous time has inspired many legends. The most enduring is the legend of the yellow star, which symbolizes the loyalty and fearless spirit of the king and his people.<br>New York Times best-selling author and storyteller Carmen Agra Deedy has poignantly recreated this legend, which is accompanied by Danish illustrator Henri S�rensen&#x2019;s arresting full-color portraits.

However, on account of its difficult and archaic style, it is scarcely read today. The time has come to translate it into modern English so that Hooker may teach a new generation of churchmen and Christian leaders about law, reason, Scripture, church, and politics. In this second volume of an ongoing translation project by the Davenant Trust, we present Book I of Hooker&#x2019;s Laws, for which he is perhaps most famous. Here he offers a sweeping overview of his theology of law, law being that order and measure by which God governs the universe, and by which all creatures&#x2014;and humans above all&#x2014;conduct their lives and affairs. In an age when the idea of natural creation order is under wholesale attack, even within the church, Hooker&#x2019;s luminous treatment of the relation of Scripture and nature, faith and reason is a priceless and urgently-needed gift to the church.</p><p></p><h2>A People&#39;s History of the United States (Harper Perennial Deluxe Editions)</h2><p><p><strong>"A wonderful, splendid book--a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future." --Howard Fast</strong></p><p>With a new introduction by Anthony Arnove, this edition of the classic national bestseller chronicles American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official narrative taught in schools&#x2014;with its emphasis on great men in high places&#x2014;to focus on the street, the home and the workplace.</p><p>Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, <em>A People's History</em> <em>of the United States</em> is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of&#x2014;and in the words of&#x2014;America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers.

Goldberg is Johann Gottlieb Goldberg, a young musician in the court of Count Keyserlingk, a Russian ambassador living in Dresden. It isn&#x2019;t known for certain why Bach&#x2019;s difficult composition was named for the young man, but Anna Harwell Celenza gives us one possible story based on extensive research.</p><p><p> When we think about classical music, the names of great composers often come to mind. But music history is as much about performers and listeners as it is about composers. The characters in this story really did exist. Count Keyserlingk, a Russian ambassador living in Dresden, first came in contact with Johann Gottlieb Goldberg (1727-1756) in 1737; he was so amazed by the boy&#x2019;s talent that he offered him a position at court, where he was allowed to take music lessons with both Johann Sebastian Bach and his son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach.<br><br>J. S. Bach&#x2019;s first biographer, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, reported that in the early 1740s Count Keyserlingk became ill and suffered sleepless nights. During these bouts of insomnia, Goldberg was often called upon to entertain the count with music. Scholars do not know the precise historical circumstances surrounding Goldberg&#x2019;s acquisition of Bach&#x2019;s composition. Some believe Count Keyserlingk commissioned the work; others propose that Bach gave the piece to Goldberg directly. Whatever the circumstances, it is known that Bach visited the count in Dresden in 1741 and that shortly thereafter Goldberg began playing the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> for Count Keyserlingk and his friends.<br><br>The <i>Goldberg Variations</i> is unlike any other piece written by Bach. It is monumental in scope, extremely difficult to play, and unusual for its extended use of repetition. The theme and thirty variations present an assortment of musical styles: some variations are inspired by dance pieces or orchestral genres, while others take the form of a canon or fugue. The final variation, the musical riddle, is a genre called a quodlibet, which means &#x201c;whatever you please&#x201d; in Latin. It&#x2019;s a humorous collection of various tunes played at once.<br><br>Today, some performers play the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> on piano. But it was originally composed for the harpsichord, as the piano had not yet been invented. The harpsichord resembles the piano in appearance, but it produces quite a different sound. Whereas the piano&#x2019;s sound is created by small hammers hitting the strings, the harpsichord&#x2019;s sound is created by small hooks or quills that pluck the strings.<br><br>When Bach published his impressive set of variations in 1742, he called them <i>A Keyboard Practice Consisting of an Aria with Thirty Variations for the Harpsichord</i>. Given the length of this title, we can see why the count&#x2019;s name for the piece, the <i>Goldberg Variations</i>, stuck more than 250 years ago and still remains popular today.<br><br>&#x2015; <i>Anna Harwell Celenza</i></p> <p></p>Anna Harwell Celenza is a musicologist and the author of several books for adults and children regarding music history and the history of art.

He couldn't be, David thought. But as the couple pored over the Unabomber's seventy-eight-page manifesto, David couldn't rule out the possibility. It slowly became clear to them that Ted was likely responsible for mailing the seventeen bombs that killed three people and injured many more. Wanting to prevent further violence, David made the agonizing decision to turn his brother in to the FBI.&nbsp;<i>Every Last Tie</i> is David's highly personal and powerful memoir of his family, as well as a meditation on the possibilities for reconciliation and maintaining family bonds. Seen through David's eyes, Ted was a brilliant, yet troubled, young mathematician and a loving older brother. Their parents were supportive and emphasized to their sons the importance of education and empathy. But as Ted grew older he became more and more withdrawn, his behavior became increasingly erratic, and he often sent angry letters to his family from his isolated cabin in rural Montana.&nbsp;&nbsp;During Ted's trial David worked hard to save Ted from the death penalty, and since then he has been a leading activist in the anti&#x2013;death penalty movement. The book concludes with an afterword by psychiatry professor and forensic psychiatrist James L. Knoll IV, who discusses the current challenges facing the mental health system in the United States as well as the link between mental illness and violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>David Kaczynski is the past Executive Director of Karma Triyana Dharmachakra, a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located in Woodstock, New York. An anti&#x2013;death penalty activist, Kaczynski served as the Executive Director of New Yorkers Against the Death Penalty from 2001 to 2012 and has given hundreds of public talks throughout the United States about mental illness, the death penalty, and healing in the aftermath of tragic violence.

Knoll IV, MD is the Director of Forensic Psychiatry and Professor of Psychiatry at State University of New York Upstate Medical University and has served as a consulting forensic expert for the ACLU, as well as for many law enforcement agencies including the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice.&nbsp;<br>"Deeds of inhumanity challenge us to discover our own deeper humanity. David Kaczynski has done so, both in his life and in this very moving memoir he has written about his family."&nbsp; (Sister Helen Prejean, author of <i>Dead Man Walking</i>)<br><br>"An extraordinarily deep, moving, thoughtful, and profound memoir. This brother's story is a generous shattering journey. This author truly has an 'open and fearless heart.' And the book ends with a turn that turns the personal into the profoundly political, with an afterword by psychiatrist James Knoll who writes about mental illness, mental illness policy, and violence with incredible insight and compassion, including his own responsibilities after the Sandy Hook massacre. A powerful book for our times."&nbsp; (Cathy N.

Faced with a relentless flood of information and distractions, our brains try to process everything at once increasing our stress, decreasing our effectiveness and negatively impacting our performance. Ironically, we have become too overworked, unfocused, and busy to stop and ask ourselves the most important question: What can we do to break the cycle of being constantly under pressure, always-on, overloaded with information and in environments filled with distractions? Do we need to accept this as the new workplace reality and continue to survive rather than thrive in modern day work environments? Thankfully, the answer is no. In their new book, ONE SECOND AHEAD: Enhance Your Performance at Work with Mindfulness (Palgrave Macmillan; November 2015), Rasmus Hougaard, Jacqueline Carter, and Gillian Coutts demonstrate that it is possible to train the brain to respond differently to today&#39;s constant pressures and distraction. All it takes is one second. They propose that we need to learn to work differently so we are more focused, calm and have less clutter in our mind so we can better manage our time and attention. What if we could hit the &#39;pause&#39; button on our day, step back, and meet challenges with a sense of clarity and purpose? And what if there was a way not just of &#39;getting things done,&#39; but ensuring that what does get done are the right things to do? Based on a program in corporate mindfulness designed by Hougaard and the partners of The Potential Project, One Second Ahead provides practical tools and techniques as well as real-world examples and lessons from organizations that have implemented mindfulness on a large scale. Thoroughly tested in a diverse range of industries, this program has resulted in measurable increases in productivity, effectiveness, and job satisfaction. With the new mindset proposed in One Second Ahead, readers will be able to put an end to ineffective multitasking, unproductive meetings, poor communication, and other unhealthy workplace behaviors by applying mindfulness to every day work life. All too often, we think that being mindful requires engaging in a special activity like meditation or yoga. Sure, these activities are beneficial and important to train the mind, but there are many simple things we can do to be mindful all day long. One Second Ahead is a handbook for more mindful work that offers: Practical, easy to apply, tools and techniques to enhance performance and effectiveness in day to day work activities such as meetings, emails, communication, planning, creativity and more Real-world stories of how mindfulness changed the workdays of leaders and front line employees Tips for cultivating mental strategies and routines that can reduce clutter, increase focus, and rewire your brain to enhance presence, patience, kindness and other valuable mind states Simple yet detailed step-by-step instructions for a more systematic approach to mindfulness training to enhance focus and awareness Guidelines for a 10-minute-per-day mindfulness program that can reshape your life both at work and at home; A reproducible planning worksheet and further resources in the Appendix. One Second Ahead can transform daily work life by helping individuals and teams realize more of their potential through greater focus and awareness. The tools and techniques in this book can transform individual and organizational performance one mind at a time.</p><p>Rasmus Hougaard is an internationally recognized authority on training the mind to be more focused, effective, and clear in an organizational context.

In this dramatic narrative written especially for students and general readers, Sheldon M. Stern, longtime historian at the John F. Kennedy Library, enables the reader to follow the often harrowing twists and turns of the crisis.<br>Based on the author&#x2019;s authoritative transcriptions of the secretly recorded ExComm meetings, the book conveys the emotional ambiance of the meetings by capturing striking moments of tension and anger as well as occasional humorous intervals. Unlike today's readers, the participants did not have the luxury of knowing how this potentially catastrophic showdown would turn out, and their uncertainty often gives their discussions the nerve-racking quality of a fictional thriller. As President Kennedy told his advisers, &#x201c;What we are doing is throwing down a card on the table in a game which we don't know the ending of.&#x201d;<br>Stern documents that JFK and his administration bore a substantial share of the responsibility for the crisis. Covert operations in Cuba, including efforts to kill Fidel Castro, had convinced Nikita Khrushchev that only the deployment of nuclear weapons could protect Cuba from imminent attack. However, President Kennedy, a seasoned Cold Warrior in public, was deeply suspicious of military solutions to political problems and appalled by the prospect of nuclear war. He consistently steered policy makers away from an apocalyptic nuclear conflict, measuring each move and countermove with an eye to averting what he called, with stark eloquence, &#x201c;the final failure.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c; . . . The Week The World Stood Still is an impressive work of scholarship that is also highly recommended for non-specialist general readers with an interest in the history of the Cold War era.&#x201d;&#x2014;The Midwest Book ReviewSheldon M.

In just three decades it evolved into the world&#x2019;s second-largest economy and is today guided by highly entrepreneurial bureaucrats. In <i>How China Escaped the Poverty Trap</i>, Yuen Yuen Ang explains this astonishing metamorphosis. Rather than insist that either strong institutions of good governance foster markets or that growth enables good governance, Ang lays out a new, dynamic framework for understanding development broadly. Successful development, she contends, is a coevolutionary process in which markets and governments mutually adapt.</p><p>By mapping this coevolution, Ang reveals a startling conclusion: poor and weak countries can escape the poverty trap by first harnessing weak institutions&#x2015;features that defy norms of good governance&#x2015;to build markets. Further, she stresses that adaptive processes, though essential for development, do not automatically occur. Highlighting three universal roadblocks to adaptation, Ang identifies how Chinese reformers crafted enabling conditions for effective improvisation. </p><p><i>How China Escaped the Poverty Trap</i> offers the most complete synthesis to date of the numerous interacting forces that have shaped China&#x2019;s dramatic makeover and the problems it faces today. Looking beyond China, Ang also traces the coevolutionary sequence of development in late medieval Europe, antebellum United States, and contemporary Nigeria, and finds surprising parallels among these otherwise disparate cases. Indispensable to all who care about development, this groundbreaking book challenges the convention of linear thinking and points to an alternative path out of poverty traps.</p></p><p><p>Yuen Yuen Ang is Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Michigan.

Anyone concerned with institutions,development, or the role of China in the world, should read this elegantly written book."&nbsp;<br>--&nbsp;Peter Katzenstein Book Prize Committee,&nbsp;for "best book in international relations,comparative politics, or political economy."&nbsp;<br><br>"The first takeaway of the book, that a poor country can harness the institutions they have and get development going is a liberating message... This provocative message challenges our prevailing practice of assessing a country's institutions by their distance from the global best practice... The second part of the book is equally thought provoking. While adaptive approaches to development have become new buzzwords, Yuen Yuen's work brings rigor to this conversation... this analytical lens has enormous potential for thinking through the adaptive challenge, whether at the national level, subnational level or sectoral level."<br>--Yongmei Zhou (Director of the World Development Report 2017),&nbsp;<i>World Bank Development Blog</i> <br><br><i>How China Escaped the Poverty Trap</i>... is an original and insightful take on what is perhaps the biggest development puzzle of my lifetime... Her unconventional insight is that the first challenge of development is to&nbsp;harness 'weak/wrong/bad' institutions to create markets...&nbsp;China wanted to begin a process of "adaptation" and for that they needed to create conditions conducive to "directed improvisation."... Professor Ang is making important advances in understanding how development can be made possible in her approach to Complexity and Development 2.0.<br>-- Lant Pritchett (Harvard Kennedy School), State Capability Blog <br><br>"Ang provides specialists and nonspecialists alike with a fresh inside-the-black-box account of how the Chinese state--from the center to the periphery, across time and space--has actually practiced (not merely preached) innovation, problem solving, and effective implementation... Future studies of bureaucratic life in China and elsewhere must reckon seriously with Ang's account; she has set an admirably high bar and capably filled a conspicuous scholarly vacuum. It is encouraging that the development policy community is also taking note... Her book is compelling, important, and deserving of a wide audience."&nbsp;<br>-- Michael Woolcock (World Bank), <i>Governance&nbsp;</i> <br><br>This book is a triumph, opening a window onto the political economy of China&#x2019;s astonishing rise that takes as its starting point systems and complexity. Its lessons apply far beyond China&#x2019;s borders... Ang reveals...

The first is methodological. She expresses a frustration with political science&#x2019;s causality obsession and modeling approaches that deliver isolated snapshots of complex processes... Ang&#x2019;s second ambition is to apply this coevolutionary schema to how we understand economic development generally. -- Edmund Malesky (Duke University), Perspectives on Politics<br><br>More unusual are political economy studies that formulate an argument about a recent economic development experience and argue that the principles explaining it are the same as those found in prominent approaches to economic history, thereby proposing an interpretation of economic history scholarship in light of more contemporary developments. Yuen Yuen Ang achieves precisely this with her new interpretation of China&#x2019;s economic development path. Her key conceptual innovation is to bring complexity theory into the study of economic growth. -- Bin Wong (UCLA, History), Journal of Economic History<br><br>I had also not imagined that China, and its remarkable economic growth over the past four decades, would provide such a rich example of complexity principles in action. -- Keith Johnston, Cultivating Leadership Blog (New Zealand)<br><br><p><strong>NAMED "BEST OF BOOKS IN 2017" BY FOREIGN AFFAIRS</strong></p> <p>China's transformation cannot be attributed to a single cause; rather, it arose from a contingent, interactive process&#x2014;Ang calls it 'directed improvisation.' She formalizes this insight by using a novel analytic method that she terms 'coevolutionary narrative,' which has the potential to influence future studies of institutional and economic change beyond China.</p> <p>-- Andrew J.

It feels like her big sister Emma is just the opposite&#x2014;she is sweet, respectful, and good at just about everything that Lizzie isn&#x2019;t. When Lizzie and Emma begins, Lizzie is eight years old and it&#x2019;s not that she wishes she weren&#x2019;t the kind of girl who loves hiding for hours to read a good book or racing down too-steep hills on her sled or eating lots of doughnuts.

Probably a lot more than you think. St. Ignatius of Loyola wasn&#x2019;t always the heroic and holy figure that you hear about today; he was a flawed, fallible, and relatable man named ��igo Lopez. In <i>Just Call Me Lopez</i>, a twenty-first-century woman, Rachel, meets the man who becomes the saint, and both are transformed by their unlikely friendship and series of thought-provoking conversations.<br><br>Their worlds literally collide when Rachel is struck by a hit-and-run driver, and Lopez is there to help her. They realize that this chance accident is actually an act of God that allows Rachel and Lopez, through the medium of their friendship, to come to terms with their personal struggles. Lopez shares his life with Rachel, describing the obstacles he faces during his unbelievable conversion from a womanizing soldier to a man of God. While Rachel keeps mostly silent about her personal struggles, she observes and is astounded by Lopez&#x2019;s metamorphosis from mess to mystic. Rachel finally faces her troubling situation, and Lopez gently guides her through the process of discernment to make a difficult, but inspired, life choice.<br><br><i>Just Call Me Lopez</i> helps us realize that our very human faults and imperfect behavior do not prevent us from receiving God&#x2019;s grace; rather, knowing our weaknesses and giving ourselves over to the Holy Spirit can create a new way for us to live.<br></p><p>Margaret Silf is a popular retreat director and the best-selling author of many Loyola Press books, including <i>The Other Side of Chaos, Inner Compass, Close to the Heart</i>, and <i>Simple Faith</i>.

That&#x2019;s the implicit question posed in this intriguing time travel experiment by Silf, whose previous book, Inner Compass, explored the fundamentals of Ignatian spirituality in a modern context. In a series of fictional encounters between her narrator, Rachel, and the Jesuit founder (never mind the initial premise, which is a bit awkward), the writer introduces readers to the biography of a Christian mystic whose writings and methods continue to have an outsize influence on contemporary Christian spiritual practices. Using accessible language and inviting vignettes, she also explores topics that include praying with the Scriptures, the use of the imagination, and suggestions for how to follow in the footsteps of Christ. Though Silf asserts that her heroine Rachel is a work of fiction, there&#x2019;s a fascinating and persistent critique of ecclesiastical hierarchy that raises its own questions.

Celebrated for his courageous reporting on the crucial issues of our time, Hedges, who graduated from seminary at Harvard Divinity School, explores the challenge of living according to these moral precepts we have tried to follow, often unsuccessfully, for the past 6,000 years. The commandments, he writes, do not save us from evil. Instead they save us from committing evil. <br> <br> Inspired by unyielding faith, rigorous moral scrutiny, and a fierce sense of social responsibility, Hedges offers a breathtaking meditation on modern life. <i>Losing Moses on the Freeway</i> illustrates how the commandments usually choose us -- and how we are rarely able to choose them. We cannot protect ourselves from theft, greed, adultery, or envy, nor from the impulses that lead us to commit evil acts. In honoring the commandments, we free ourselves from self-worship and are called back to the healing solidarity of community. It is in the self-sacrifice championed by the commandments that integrity, commitment, and, finally, love are made possible.</p><p>Why should <i>all Americans</i> &#x2013;not just Christians and Jews -- care about the Ten Commandments? Chris Hedges, a former foreign correspondent for the <i>New York Times</i> and Harvard Divinity School graduate, believes that the commandments keep us from committing evil. They hold our communities together. "They lead us to love, the essence of life," he writes. <p> Adapted from his series of articles for the <i>New York Times</i> comes these thoughtful essays on why we need these ancient laws -- and what happens when we abandon them. A Phish band groupie provides a springboard for a discussion of idolatry. A Long Island whiskey bar becomes a laboratory for understanding "You shall not bear false witness." Honoring the Sabbath, he shows through the observances of one busy family, may be the antidote to popular culture. The story of the havoc wreaked on one child&#x2019;s life vividly illustrates the reason for the commandment, "You shall not commit adultery." Throughout his essays, he deftly weaves his own experiences into the narrative, as well as references from Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x2019;s classic book on good and evil, <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>. </p><p> Hedges believes that the commandments hold out to us the possibility of love -- and love means living for others. The commandments are guideposts that bring us back to the right path, he writes. They call us to sacrifice. Compellingly, he urges us to abandon the culture of self; to live "not by exalting our life but by being willing to lose it." --<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for <i>The New York Times,&nbsp;</i>where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper.

Today, theologians rise against the Pope, laymen turn away in dismay and confusion.</p> <p>McInerney cuts through conventional wisdom to reveal the council's true message--a message which, if widely known, would send shock waves through both the conservative and liberal wings on the Church...and would bring many Catholics back to the practice of the Faith.</p> <p>After Vatican II, instead of enjoying the expected renaissance, the Church seemed to fall apart: priests and bishops rejected Church teachings, convents and seminaries emptied, and laypeople were thrown into confusion. I vividly remember my own dismay when I discovered that although I had entered the Catholic Church because I had come to see (with Cardinal Newman's help) the necessity for a teaching authority, large numbers of Catholics were chafing under that authority and yearning for an illusory freedom. This strange rebellion in the post-Vatican II Church is examined and blisteringly rebuked in Ralph McInerny's <em>What Went Wrong with Vatican II</em>. McInerny contends that the problem wasn't Vatican II itself, which, as an ecumenical council, enjoyed the protection of the Holy Spirit. The problem, he argues, came afterward: with <em>Humanae Vitae</em>, Pope Paul VI's restatement of the Church's constant teaching that artificial contraception is immoral. Instead of greeting it with respect and obedience, a large group of clergy dissented publicly from Humanae Vitae and touched off a civil war in the Church as they competed with the Vatican for the obedience of the faithful.</p> <p>In this crucial book, McInerny traces the problem and shows what we must do now to restore the Church.</p></p><p></p>
